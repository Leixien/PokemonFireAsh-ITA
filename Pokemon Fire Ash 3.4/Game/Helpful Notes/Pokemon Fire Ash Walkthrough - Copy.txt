------------------------------
GENERATION 1: THE KANTO REGION
------------------------------

------------
PALLET TOWN:
------------
Take out a Potion from your computer, then head downstairs. Leave the house, and head east to Professor Oak's Lab. Talk to Gary who blocks the way and listen to him brag about getting the best pokemon... jerk.

Go up the stairs and grab a Potion in the upper left part of the ledge before entering the lab.

Enter Oak's Lab. Note that the machine in the middle of the room will heal your party. Go to the 2nd floor and talk with Professor Oak. Oak tells you that all the pokemon have been taken except for one, your ICONIC Pikachu.

Take the Pokeball with the ICONIC Pikachu, though he won't be spending much time in the Pokeball from now on. Grab the Pikachu off the table. Upon doing so, you'll get your first outfit. Grab the Pokedex and the five Pokeballs on your way out.

If you go to the house to the right of the house you first came out of, you can talk to the girl to get a Town Map, which currently only has maps until the Unova Region.

Leave Pallet Town to the west, where you'll find your mom waiting for you. She'll give you the Running Shoes and wish you luck on your journey.

--------
ROUTE 1:
--------
Wild Pokemon (* before name means that this is your first chance to get that Pokemon. I will only put them next to unevolved Pokemon): *Pidgey, *Spearow, *Rattata, *Poliwag, *Sandshrew, *Mankey. Usual level 2-5.

Ho-oh also appears here, but it has a 1% encounter rate AND it is level 50. You should wait to grow stronger before attempting to catch it, but it's technically possible even now.

Talk to the second person you see to get a Super Potion. There is also a Rare Candy hidden in a bush on the right side of the route across the bridge.

Go north to Viridian City.

--------------
VIRIDIAN CITY:
--------------
Go to the west, then north to get a Pokeball. Guarding the Pokeball is a Move Tutor who can teach your pokemon the move Snore. Note that the item behind the Gym can't be obtained at this time.

SE of the Pokemon Centre is a guy who will tell you about how trade evolutions work in Fire Ash.

Team Rocket (will be abbreviated TR from now on) is in the Pokemon Centre. You must defeat them to unlock the north exit from the city.
ICONIC BATTLE
TR Jessie and James
Ekans LV 4
Koffing LV 4

The pokemart sells:
Poke Ball - 200
Potion - 300

Defeating them also means that your mom, back in Pallet Town, will heal your party when you talk to her from now on.

The path west (Route 22) is blocked until you get 8 badges, so go north.

---------------------
ROUTE 2 (South Side):
---------------------
Follow the road to find a guy who will tell you about where you can find his friends. They will tell you about how trade evolutions work in Fire Ash.

Enter Viridian Forest.

----------------
VIRIDIAN FOREST:
----------------
Wild Pokemon: *Caterpie, *Weedle, Kakuna, Beedrill, Pidgey, Pidgeotto, Spearow, rarely Fearow. Usual level 3-5.

Upon entering, head left to find an ICONIC LV 4 Caterpie. It's the first of the many ICONIC Pokemon that you'll receive as a gift during your travels. From there, head east then north to find an ICONIC LV 7 Pidgeotto.

There are 4 trainers in the Forest.
Bug Catcher Rick
Caterpie LV 6
Weedle LV 6

Bug Catcher Anthony
Caterpie LV 7
Caterpie LV 8

Bug Catcher Doug
Weedle LV 7

MINOR ICONIC
Bug Catcher Samurai
Pinsir LV 7
Metapod LV 7

Items:
Antidote: In tall grass in SW part of the forest.
Pokeball: Hidden in the NW corner of the glade when you enter the forest (almost directly NW from your starting position, in the corner). The way to pick hidden items in this game might be worth mentioning here. You must step next to the target tile, turn towards the target tile, and press the action button.
Antidote: In tall grass in the SE part of the forest.
Potion: In the NW part of the forest.

Exit north.

---------------------
ROUTE 2 (North Side):
---------------------
Continue north to Pewter City. You can’t use HMs outside of battle in the game, so you won’t be able to access the house behind the cut tree.

------------
PEWTER CITY:
------------
Immediately go around the trees on your right and back south to Route 2 to grab TM54 (False Swipe).

Towards the top of the city you'll find the Pewter Museum of Science. It has two Fossil Revivers who can revive fossils for you. Outside, you’ll also find a move tutor for Iron Defence.

In the NW corner of the city, there's a Pokeball hidden on the 2nd tile from the top. Note that there is a slight discoloration in the tile. Many hidden items have similar tile discolorations.

Gym: 1 trainer + Brock.
Camper Liam
Rhyhorn LV 7
Geodude LV 7

ICONIC BATTLE
GYM LEADER BROCK (2v2)
Geodude LV 8
Onix LV 9

Having a Butterfree makes the gym battle much easier - it's pretty strong, and despite its 4 times weakness to rock type attacks Brock's team has none of those yet.
Defeating Brock gets you a Boulder Badge and TM80 (Rock Slide).

As an alternative to using Fly (which is also in the game now), Fire Ash uses a system where you can teleport to places you have been to, provided that there's a Pokemon Centre there and that certain conditions have been fulfilled, e.g. defeating the gym leader of the place. For now, you can teleport from Pewter City to Viridian City, which marks the start of the Kanto Teleport System (since Brock was defeated).

If you go inside the house in the NW part of the city, you will find Brock's younger siblings. In the NW corner is the eldest sibling, Forrest. Talk to him to obtain TM37 (Sandstorm).

You now have 1 badge, which means that Pokemarts expand their inventory. Their inventory now is:
Poke Ball - 200
Great Ball - 600
Potion - 300
Super Potion - 700
Antidote - 100
Paralyze Heal - 200
Awakening - 250
Burn Heal - 250
Ice Heal - 250
Escape Rope - 550
Repel - 350

Leave to the east.

--------
ROUTE 3:
--------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Spearow, *Jigglypuff, *NidoranM, *NidoranF, Mankey, rarely *Ekans. Level 3-8.
This is your first chance to obtain Ekans, however it only has a 1% encounter rate. There will be better chances later if you don't want to spend a lot of time searching for it now.

Enter the cave to Mt Moon.

---------
MT. MOON:
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Zubat, *Clefairy, Clefable, and *Paras appear on both floors. *Geodude appears only on the upper floor, while Sandshrew only appears on the lower floor. Usual level is 5-10.

Start by going to the left to fight a trainer and grab a Nugget.
Bug Catcher Kent
Weedle LV 11
Kakuna LV 11

Then take the ladder down; you'll get to an enclosed chamber with a trainer and two items: An Antidote to the left and a Revive to the right.
Hiker Marcus
Onix LV 12

On the upper floor, go north and east from the ladder. The correct route is north and west, but explore the SE part of the floor for some goodies: there are 2 trainers in this section (one on the left, one on the right) and 2 items: TM46 (Thief) on the left and a hidden Ether; there is a formation of 3 rocks in the SE corner of the floor; the Ether is in the middle rock.
Super Nerd Jovan
Magnemite LV 11
Voltorb LV 11

Bug Catcher Robby
Caterpie LV 10 x2
Metapod LV 10

Going along the correct route, you will find another trainer.
Lass Iris
Clefairy LV 14

Turn the corner to head south and find another ladder leading down to a room. Before heading down, grab the Revive in the SW corner of this room. Take the ladder.

From where you appear on the lower floor, go north. There are three rocks in the northern part of this room; the one on the right hides a Moon Stone.

There's a trainer directly below the ladder.
Youngster Josh
Rattata LV 10 x2
Zubat LV 10

After him you'll come to two sets of stairs. The stairs on the left lead to a guy who gives you TM08 (Bulk Up). There is an Escape Rope north of him. The stairs on the right lead you around the floor, past 2 other trainers, to the ladder up.
Lass Miriam
Oddish LV 11
Bellsprout LV 11

Super Nerd Miguel
Grimer LV 10 x2
Voltorb LV 10

There is a hiker by the exit, but you don't battle him. Before you take the ladder out, there is another Ether, hidden in an empty spot in the middle of the NW rock formation.

Once you take the ladder, go west and exit the cave.

--------
ROUTE 4:
--------
Nothing to do here right now. Exit east.

--------------
CERULEAN CITY:
--------------
Talk to the pink-haired girl to obtain an Eviolite.

Go to the NW house and leave through the back door. There's a Rare Candy hidden in the garden behind the house; it's in the top row, on the left empty tile between two blue flowers.

The house next to the Pokemon Centre has an old man who will trade you his Tangela for your Rattata.

The house north of the Gym has a guy who will give you TM27 (Return).

The Gym has 2 trainers plus Misty.

ICONIC BATTLE
GYM LEADER MISTY (2v2)
Staryu LV 17
Starmie LV 19

Defeating Misty gets you the Cascade Badge and TM55 (Scald). Cerulean City is now added to the Kanto Teleport System.

Go south. You will have to take the long way around behind the gym because there's a tree in your way.

--------
ROUTE 5:
--------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, *Meowth, *Oddish. Level 10-16.

Route 5 can be entered from the left, right, or center. Wild Pokemon are only on the middle route. There's also one trainer, the unofficial Gym Leader AJ, with his Sandshrew.
MINOR ICONIC
Youngster AJ
Sandshrew LV 16

At the south end of this part is the Day Care center to raise and breed your Pokemon. The important thing to note is that in order to pick up Pokemon you leave there or an egg (the old man outside will give you an egg, when one is generated) you must have an empty spot in your party. There is a PC inside.

This is your first chance to obtain a Cleffa or Igglybuff by breeding Clefairy or Jigglypuff respectively. Female Clefairy and Jigglypuff can be caught in Mt Moon or on Route 3, respectively, if you only have male ones. At this point you only have one Pikachu and he's a guy, so you won't be able to obtain Pichu until you get a Ditto.
That being said, you can get your Pichu to be born with Volt Tackle if the Pikachu is holding a Light Ball, which you will get later, so I'd suggest waiting a bit in any case.

On the west side of the route, there is a gap in the fence. Go through it, then south and east along the fence to obtain a Revive at the end of the path.

The gatehouse is impassable for now, so go through the trees beyond the gap in the fence to enter Hidden Village.

---------------
HIDDEN VILLAGE:
---------------
Wild Pokemon: Rattata, Paras, Oddish, Weepinbell, Caterpie, *Staryu, *Magikarp. Usual level 10-15.
This is your first chance to get a Weepinbell, the evolved form of Bellsprout. Bellsprout can be caught a bit further into the game.

Hidden Village is one long, winding path and you'll have to go through a lot of grass patches, so be prepared. There is only one visible item (Big Root) which is around the middle of the path -- you can't really miss it. However, there are also 4 hidden items:

1: After the first patch of grass, you will see two red flowers on opposite vertices of a 3x5 rectangle. A Sitrus Berry is hidden in the center of this rectangle.
2: The second patch of grass is out of the way so you don't have to go through it. You DO have to go through the third patch. North of this patch are two red flowers. Three tiles west and one tile north from the top flower is a Leppa Berry.
3: The fourth patch of tall grass is the largest one and it covers most of the bottom part of the path. Hug the northern edge of the path. You'll go through two tall grass tiles, and then there are three empty tiles. A Lum Berry is hidden on the left empty tile.
4: After leaving the fourth patch, you'll enter the final area of Hidden Village. From the SW red flower, a Chesto Berry is two tiles east and three tiles north.

At the end of the village is Melanie (from the anime) and an ICONIC LV 12 Bulbasaur.

After getting Bulbasaur, go east into the trees to Route 24. Be sure to grab the Everstone on the way out.

---------
ROUTE 24:
---------
Weather forecast: Sometimes rainy
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Caterpie, Oddish, *Venonat, Weedle, Metapod, Kakuna, *Abra, *Bellsprout, Pidgeotto. Usual level 7-14.

There are 8 trainers.

Enter the Pokemon Centre and talk to the guy on the right (Damien). He'll tell you he ditched his Charmander. Well, one man's trash...

Leave the Pokemon Centre and go east. There's an ICONIC LV 15 Charmander on the rock. If you’ve talked to his former trainer, you can take him. Once you have him, return to the Pokemon Centre and talk to the guy on the left to obtain a Charcoal.

Note: You should try to train up Charmander and evolve it into Charizard. To obtain a TM later, you will need a Charizard.

Go south.

---------
ROUTE 25:
---------
Route 25 has several parts. We can't enter the southern part right now so we can't fight wild Pokemon. You'll have to resolve the problem with the Squirtle Squad from the anime.

Enter the top left house to encounter TR once again.
ICONIC BATTLE
TR Jessie and James
Ekans LV 18
Koffing LV 18

After defeating them, talk to the ICONIC LV 15 Squirtle and take him with you. Once you have Squirtle, talk to the cop outside to get Black Glasses, which means that you have 2 pairs of them, since Squirtle holds one as well. You can now go through the southern part of the route.

Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Meowth, Oddish, Bellsprout. Usual level 10-15.
Fishing (Old Rod): Krabby. Level 15 - 22
Fishing (Good Rod): Krabby Level 15 - 22, Dragonite Level 20 - 22
Fishing (Super Rod): Krabby Level 25 - 32, Dragonite Level 30 - 22

There are 6 trainers in this part, including a pair of double trainers.

In the very NW corner of this part, you can find a hidden Ether.

After you pass the part with tall grass, you'll see a lighthouse. Enter it and talk to the Pokemon inside. It's actually Bill. Agree to help him and he will reward you with Old Rod. Talk to Bill again and "Someone's PC" where you store your Pokemon will be renamed to "Bill's PC".

Also, be sure to access the computer in Bill's lighthouse. Doing so will greatly expand your PC boxes, up to a total of 56 boxes, each with a capacity of 30 pokemon. That means that you can store a total of 1,680 pokemon!

With the Old Rod, you can now start fishing. Unfortunately, all places where you've been so far only have Magikarp and Poliwag available with Old Rod. You can still grab them if you haven't got them yet.

However, Route 25 itself is special. There are two new pokemon that appear here in the water. One is Krabby, which you can get even with the old rod from level 15 to 22. However the other pokemon is in fact, a Dragonite, the pseudo-legendary of the Kanto region. It has a 20% chance to appear with a Good Rod, but you don't get one until Hoenn, and by then, you could have a LV 55+ Dragonite (if you evolve a Dragonair).

Catch a Krabby if you want and go south. There is also an ICONIC LV 15 Krabby directly south of the lighthouse if you want to save time.

---------------
VERMILION CITY:
---------------
Go east where a sailor and his Machop are. Directly south of the plot of land is TM111 (Dazzling Gleam).

The orange-roofed house in the middle row (west of Pokemart) has a kid who will trade his Farfetch'd for your Spearow.

Next to this house is the Pokemon Fan Club. Talk to the old man and agree to listen to him ramble about his Fearow to get a Bicycle.

The eastern path that leads out of town has a move tutor that will teach your pokemon Super Fang.

Brock is in front of the gym and you must defeat him again to enter the gym.

Electabuzz LV 20

ICONIC BATTLE
GYM LEADER LT. SURGE (1v1)
Raichu LV 20

In order to get to Lt. Surge, you will need to find two switches hidden in the trash cans. Both of them are in the top row: the one on the left end and the third one from the right.

Defeating Lt. Surge nets you the Thunder Badge and TM24 (Thunderbolt). It will also allow you to obtain a Light Ball from the lady in Pokemon Fan Club. And as before, Vermilion City is added to the Kanto Teleport System (like Pewter and Cerulean City).

Another benefit of defeating Lt. Surge is that a small tree in Cerulean City will be finally cut, making travel between Cerulean City and Route 5 much easier.

Now that you have 3 badges, the Pokemart's inventory updates again:
Poke Ball - 200
Great Ball - 600
Potion - 300
Super Potion - 700
Hyper Potion - 1200
Revive - 2000
Antidote - 100
Paralyze Heal - 200
Awakening - 250
Burn Heal - 250
Ice Heal - 250
Escape Rope - 550
Repel - 350
Super Repel - 500

The way east from the city is blocked by a sailor. To get past him, you must go on the S.S. Anne cruise ship. The S.S. Anne is at the right of the 3 docks in Vermilion City.

----------
S.S. ANNE:
----------
This is a big ship with four floors. You start on 1F. 1F has a row of cabins. Your cabin is the second one from the right and it contains a bed where you can heal your party and a PC. The rest of the ship is basically lots and lots of trainers.

Cabins on 1F, from left to right:

First cabin: Trainer.
Lass Ann
Pidgeotto LV 18
Nidoran F LV 18

Second cabin: Trainer.
Youngster Tyler

Third cabin: Just a guy to talk to.
Fourth cabin: Trainer.

Fifth cabin: Just people.
Sixth cabin: Just a biker.
Seventh cabin: Your cabin.

Eighth cabin: Trainer.
Gentleman Arthur
Nidoran M LV 19 x2
Nidoran F LV 19

Apart from cabins, there's a fisherman who offers you a “super-rare Pokemon” (which is actually a level 15 Magikarp). I guess that’s a rip-off?

If you go left and down, you get to the kitchen. There are three trash cans on the right side of the room, and each of them hides an item. From top to bottom: Pecha Berry, Cheri Berry, Chesto Berry.

2F, accessible through the stairs in the upper-left corner of 1F, has five more rooms. All of them, except for the leftmost one, have a trainer to fight (the second room from the left and the rightmost room have two).

MINOR ICONIC:
Gentleman Gentleman
Raticate LV 23

After you beat him, he offers to trade his Raticate for your Butterfree. You can actually talk to him again after that and trade them back, just like in the anime.

The last floor is B1F which is accessed through stairs in the bottom-right corner of 1F. First of all, grab the Hyper Potion that is hidden in the trash can next to the stairs. Then start checking the rooms.

This floor has five rooms. First four rooms from the right (where you enter the floor) contain one normal trainer each.

Ekans LV 19
Koffing LV 19
Magikarp LV 15

When you beat TR, the sinister plan is put into motion. Various sailors you've seen standing in the corridors suddenly change into TR members who will fight you. You’ll have to make your way to the captain's cabin.

There are 3 TR members on B1F (you'll have to beat all of them to get back to the stairs).

In addition, the sailor who blocked the way to the stairs in the top-right corner of 2F is now gone, letting you enter the captain's cabin. However, once you go to the captain's cabin, you can't leave until you fight the boss, so do everything else you want first!

There's two TR members in the captain's cabin, but one of them is just there to block the stairs. The other one, at the top of the room, is the one you have to fight.
TR Admin
Drowzee LV 24
Golbat LV 24

Once you defeat him, he disappears. Talk to the captain and you'll end up back in Vermilion City. The sailor on the eastern side will now let you pass.

ROUTE 11:
---------
Wild Pokemon: Sandshrew, *Drowzee, Spearow, Ekans. Level 15-18.

TM09 (Venoshock) is available in plain sight, but there's one more item: The boulder next to the house at the northern end contains an Escape Rope.

On the eastern side of this Route, there's the Butterfree mating season. Five people watch them.

Second one from top lets you release a Butterfree if you have one.

Fourth one will give you a free Great Ball.

Fifth one is a trainer to fight.
Bug Catcher Yasu
Butterfree LV 27

When you're done here, enter the house and go through the Underground Path. It's entirely uneventful, so I'm not even going to give it its own section.

--------
ROUTE 8:
--------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Meowth, Sandshrew, Ekans, *Vulpix, *Growlithe

All tall grass is in a fairly small fenced area in the middle of the Route. This patch has one visible item, TM20 (Safeguard), along the south edge, and three hidden items:

1: Rawst Berry -- two tiles west and three tiles north from the TM20.
2: Lum Berry -- one row above Rawst Berry, three tiles west from the eastern fence.
3: Lepa Berry -- in the same column as Rawst Berry, three tiles south from the northern fence.

There are 13 trainers on this route, including a pair of Double Trainers.

Route 8 connects Lavender Town (east) and Saffron City (west). You have to go through a gate house to get to Saffron City, but the guard will let you go through, unlike the one at Route 5.

For now, backtrack along Route 8 and go to Saffron City.

-------------
SAFFRON CITY:
-------------
This is the largest place we’ve found yet! Let's have a look around!

Interesting places:
House in NW corner: On the upper floor, you'll find a girl who can teach Role Play to Pokemon.
House in SE corner: Talk to the man here to get TM29 (Psychic).
Silph Co. (the tall building in the center of the city): Talk to the receptionist to get TM90 (Substitute). Also, grab a Master Ball in the middle of the room.

The Gym contains 9 rooms in a 3x3 grid. Let's number them from 1 to 9 so the NW room is 1, north room is 2, west room is 4, etc.

Each room contains a trainer except for room 8 (which is the entrance). Sabrina is in the central room (room 5). All other rooms contain 4 teleporters, which are placed roughly in the corners. Teleporters are connected in pairs (stepping on a teleporter always moves you to the paired teleporter).

So room 9 can be reached with a single teleport, rooms 3, 6, and 7 with two, rooms 1, 2, and 4 with three and central room 5 requires 4 teleports.

Unfortunately, when you defeat Sabrina, she won't give you the badge -- instead she gives you a new task: Beat Pokemon Tower in Lavender Town. Go through Route 8 to get there.

--------------
LAVENDER TOWN:
--------------
If you went here before, you'd find that the entrance to Pokemon Tower is blocked by a person who warns you away. She'll be gone now.

Three houses can be entered. The SE house contains a Name Rater who can change the nicknames of your Pokemon.

Enter Pokemon Tower.

--------------
POKEMON TOWER:
--------------
The first two floors have no wild pokemon. Only from the 3rd floor up will you start to encounter wild Pokemon.

1F: A Move Tutor for Worry Seed.
2F: Nothing of importance.

Wild Pokemon (3F-6F): *Gastly, Haunter, Gengar. Level 25 or 28.

3F: 3 trainers and Escape Rope.
Channeler Hope
Gastly LV 23

5F: 3 trainers and 3 items:
Channeler Janae
Gastly LV 25

Channeler Ruth
Gastly LV 25

Channeler Tammy
Haunter LV 25

Nugget: In the south part of the floor.
Cleanse Tag: Near the center.
Heart Scale: Go to the north end of the floor and then to the west. Heart Scale is hidden on the last tile in the dead end.

There is a mystical diagram in the center of the floor. When you enter the center of it, it will heal your party.

6F: 3 trainers and 2 items:
Channeler Angelica
Gastly LV 25 x3

Channeler Jennifer
Gastly LV 25

Channeler Emilia

7F: No random encounters, just the boss of the tower, Karina.
Channeler Karina
Gengar LV 27

Once you defeat her, she will give you TM121 (Shadow Punch).

Now you can go back to the Saffron City Gym and defeat Sabrina again.
ICONIC BATTLE
GYM LEADER SABRINA round 2 (1v1)
Kadabra LV 29

You'll get the Marsh Badge and TM04 (Calm Mind). This will also add both Saffron City and Lavender Town to the Kanto teleport system.

In addition, the other gates from Saffron City can now be passed. Route 5 lies to the north and Route 24 to the south. West is Route 7 -- a new destination.

--------
ROUTE 7:
--------
Wild Pokemon: Mankey, Primeape, Vulpix, Meowth, Pidgey, Oddish, Bellsprout, Growlithe. Level 25-27.

Misty appears in the middle of this route and you have to defeat her again. Aside from that there is an ICONIC LV 26 Primeape. Continue west to Celadon City.

CELADON CITY:
-------------
Gary blocks the door to the Pokemon Centre. Talk to him and listen to him brag a bit to get him to leave.

In the top row of houses, there is an Eevee between two of them. Speak to it to have it join your team. This one is special, as it has its Hidden Ability. Directly behind it is a lone tree. You can find a PP Up in there. 

Beside the Pokemon Centre, there is a Biker that will teach your Pokemon the move Covet.

In the SE area, a guy will give you TM21 (Frustration). You can also find an Ether if you follow the southern fence west.

In the row of 5 houses, go to the second one from the left. Talk to the man in the top right corner to receive the Coin Case.

In the game corner, there is an attendant that will let you buy coins.

Next to the Game Corner, you can exchange your coins for prizes. The attendant on the left will let you exchange coins for items:
Smoke Ball - 800 coins
Miracle Seed - 1000 coins
Charcoal - 1000 coins
Mystic Water - 1000 coins
Yellow Flute - 1600 coins

In every game corner, there will be a person that sells these items.

The attendant on the right will let you exchange coins for Pokemon:
Abra - 180 coins
Clefairy - 500 coins
*Dratini - 2800 coins
*Scyther - 5500 coins
*Porygon - 9999 coins

Note that both Dratini and Scyther can be found in Safari Zone, which you'll reach quite soon. If you want to limit your coin grinding, you can just get a Porygon, but you won’t even need to grind for Porygon if you don’t mind waiting quite a bit for it..

Coins can be won in slots or in the Voltorb Flip game. Voltorb Flip is better (doesn't cost anything to play so you can't lose), but to get better payouts, you must win multiple games in a row. http://www.voltorbflip.com/ has an application that solves the game for you, but since there can be multiple solutions, it can just lead you to make the LEAST risky moves, but not eliminate the risk entirely; thus, reaching high levels with high payouts is hard even with this -- especially since your game level can randomly drop when you lose. Also remember that if you stop playing, you'll have to start over from Lv. 1 next time.

Triple Triad:
The top right part of the Game Corner is dedicated to Triple Triad (originally from Final Fantasy VIII). There are four card players on the right and the guy behind the desk lets you buy or sell cards.

Note the bottom card player. If you beat her, you get 1 Arceus Card, which you can then use to beat her again over and over. In doing so, you can gain an excess amount of Arceus Cards which can then be sold for 400 pokedollars for more money, if you need it.

You can only buy cards for Pokemon you already own.

Person in the top left deals with a Lottery where you can win prizes if you have a Pokemon with an original Trainer ID corresponding to the lucky number. You can win:
Ultra Ball for matching the last digit.
PP Up for matching the last 2 digits.
Exp. Share for matching the last 3 digits.
Max Revive for matching the last 4 digits.
Master Ball for matching all 5 digits.

In the NW corner is a big building with two entrances - the Celadon Department Store. In the Department Store, there are two ways to travel between floors, through stairs or the elevator.

2F: Top cashier sells:
Potion - 300
Super Potion - 700
Hyper Potion - 1200
Max Potion - 2500
Full Restore - 3000
Revive - 2000
Antidote - 100

4F: The cashier here sells:
Poke Doll - 1000
Fire Stone - 2100
Thunder Stone - 2100
Water Stone - 2100
Leaf Stone - 2100

This is an important one because the evolution stones are quite handy.

5F: Two cashiers here. The top one sells:
HP Up - 9800
Protein - 9800
Iron - 9800
Calcium - 9800
Zinc - 9800

Bottom one sells:

Rooftop: Three vending machines are here, selling:
Fresh Water - 200
Soda Pop - 300
Lemonade - 350

Unlike a normal shop, you can only buy one at a time. There's a chance you'll get an extra drink for free though.

Next to the Department Store is the P1 Grand Prix building. Brock is there, as well as 5 other normal trainers and Anthony, the boss.

When you beat Anthony, he will give you a Black Belt. You can also give him Pokemon to train, similar to the Day Care. Actually, there are several people in the game who will train your Pokemon, but they all share the same ones. On one hand, it makes it easier to drop them off and pick them up, but on the other hand, only the guy at the Day Care Center can give you eggs and that's probably the main reason why you use the Day Care.

Go west to Route 16.

---------
ROUTE 16:
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Doduo, Rattata, Spearow, Raticate. Usual level 25-29.

Before tackling Cycling Road, let's visit the power plant in the north.

-------------------------
GRINGEY CITY POWER PLANT:
-------------------------
Wild Pokemon: *Grimer, *Magnemite, Muk, Magneton. Level 27-31.

Items:
Max Potion: North of the entrance.
Max Elixir: In a tile that looks slightly different to the other tiles in the power plant that is in the NW corner, just south of where Muk is.
2 Thunder Stones: One east of the Max Potion, hidden in the first rock from the left, next to the cans (hidden) and one in the SE corner (visible).
TM17 (Protect): In the NE corner.

In the NW corner, there's an ICONIC L35 Muk.
Go back out.

---------
ROUTE 16:
---------
Cycling Road can be entered through the gate. However, before you do so, go upstairs in the gate building. One of Professor Oak's aides is waiting for you on the right and will give you an Amulet Coin.

Note that while you need to have a bike to enter the Cycling Road, you are not required to ride it.

There are many trainers on this path.

A Full Restore can be found on the Cycling Road, hidden in the NW-most tile and a Max Elixir can be found on the tile just south of the signpost.

Go south to Route 17. Now you will automatically jump on a bike (if you're not already riding it).

---------
ROUTE 17:
---------
Wild Pokemon: Doduo, Rattata, Raticate, Spearow, Fearow. Usual level 25-29.

This is a long road with 6 trainers.

There's a hidden item (Rare Candy) on a tile directly above the middle of the sandy stretch. 

PP Up is hidden in the SE corner of this sandy stretch. 

Finally, there's Max Revive - at the southern end of the road, you'll see a short fence. Max Revive is hidden on the tile south of the middle section of the fence.

Continue south to Route 18.

---------
ROUTE 18:
---------
Just a small stretch of a road. There's a woman in the upper floor of the gate building that will trade your Slowbro for his Lickitung. I highly recommend not doing this trade unless you desperately want the max odds for the Game Corner lottery, since obtaining a Slowbro can be rather tedious; you can’t obtain one in the wild.

The next gym is technically right here, on Route 18, but let's check Fuchsia City to the east first.

-------------
FUCHSIA CITY:
-------------
The top of this town is a zoo with various Pokemon exhibits.

The house east of the Pokemon Centre contains Move Deleter who can remove moves from your Pokemon. This is only really useful if your pokemon has a move that was previously a HM, since for some reason you can’t forget it normally. Hopefully that’ll be fixed soon.

From the house in the SE part of the town, you can go back to the yard. There's Max Revive hidden there, on the tile adjacent to all three flowers. But what's more important, there's water to fish! Even with just the Old Rod, you can catch a Slowpoke here.

One of the people wandering around the pokemon enclosures is actually Janine, Koga's daughter. However, she won't do much except chat with you, so feel free to move on past her if you want.

As you attempt to enter the Safari Zone, there is a guy who will stop you and challenge you to a battle outside the doors.
MINOR ICONIC
Gambler Kaiser (The Safari Warden)
Dragonair LV 35

Go north to Safari Zone.

------------
SAFARI ZONE:
------------
At this point, you can only access the central (Kanto) part of the Safari Zone. Rules are: pay 500$ for the right to make 600 steps in the Safari Zone, plus 30 Safari Balls to catch wild Pokemon.

Wild Pokemon in the Kanto part: *Tauros, *Tangela, *Rhyhorn, Nidorina, Nidorino, *Exeggcute, Venonat, Parasect, Scyther, *Pinsir, *Chansey. Level 30-35.

If you didn't buy Scyther in Game Corner, this is the first chance to catch it normally. Pinsir and Chansey have only a 1% encounter rate. However, since encounters in Safari Zone are less tedious, it's not that hard to grind for them. Note that Exeggcute and Scyther are available on Route 19 just south of Fuchsia City, so that might be a better option for you.

Note: Definitely get a Tauros - you will need one for a miniquest later in the game. There is a free ICONIC Tauros as well by the lake edge at LV 35.

You can also fish here - Old Rod gets you either *Horsea or Dratini, level 30-32. Dratini is another one of those Pokemon in Game Corner.

Three visible items:
A HP Up in SW corner, a Leaf Stone in the NE corner and TM11 (Sunny Day) in the NW corner. 

There's also a hidden Nugget: Go to the NE grass patch. It has 4 grass tiles adjacent to the lake. Nugget is hidden on the second one from the left.
Once you catch what you want, go to the Gym on Route 18.

The gym has 6 trainers plus Koga.

Venomoth LV 35
Golbat LV 37

The gym has "invisible" walls -- but you can still spot them: Wall tiles have white spots in the corners. Koga will give you the Soul Badge plus TM06 (Toxic) for defeating him. This will also add Fuchsia City to the Kanto Teleport System.

In addition, if you go back to the gatehouse at the top part of Cycling Road, you can talk to the girl upstairs to obtain TM134 (Fly), which you can even use outside to battle to fly to places you’re already been to. Like the Town Map however, you can only use Fly for regions up to Unova.

Now go south from Fuchsia City to Route 19.

---------
ROUTE 19:
---------
Wild Pokemon: Venonat, *Lickitung, Butterfree, Exeggcute, Spearow, Abra, Scyther, Oddish, Exeggutor. Level 30-32. Exeggutor only has a 1% encounter rate.

Sidenote: It's far better to catch a Lickitung here rather than doing the trade for it in the gatehouse connecting Fuchsia City and Route 18.

There are 10 trainers on this Route, almost all of which are based on battles from the anime.

There are 4 items here, all hidden:

Hyper Potion: On the right side of the fourth tall grass patch is empty space bordered by trees. To find a Hyper Potion, search the third tile from the right in the top row of this space.
Heart Scale: At the left side of the fourth tall grass patch is a row of 4 empty tiles between trees and tall grass. Heart Scale is hidden in the second tile from the right, right next to a Bug Catcher Trainer.
Rare Candy: Hidden in the very NW corner of Route, next to the second house.

There are two houses on this route:

The right house contains another TR battle.

ICONIC BATTLE:

Staryu LV 35
Psyduck LV 34
Starmie LV 32
Horsea LV 31

Even when you beat her, you won't get it, sadly. Once you leave the house, the house can no longer be entered.

The left house contains an old man. If you've beaten both Koga and Misty, he will give you the Vermilion Ticket.
As the ticket name suggests, you should now go to Vermilion City. Once there, go to the middle pier of the dock. Talk to the guy there to be able to go to Cinnabar Island.

----------------
CINNABAR ISLAND:
----------------
First of all, this is the first place where you can obtain Goldeen. It can be caught even with Old Rod, at level 15-19.

There are two important buildings on the island: Cinnabar Power Shop and Pokemon Mansion.

The Power Shop has one clerk.
Power Bracer - 3000
Power Anklet - 3000
Power Weight - 3000
Power Band - 3000
Power Belt - 3000
Power Lens - 3000
Macho Brace - 3000

Don't worry about buying these now if they are too expensive. You will get them for free later on.

Outside the Power Shop, there's a Move Tutor that teaches Seismic Toss. Around the island you'll find three people that want to trade. They will trade:
Your Raichu for his Electrode (left one)
Your Venonat for her Haunter (middle one)
Your Seel for his Ponyta (right one)

But you need to clear out Pokemon Mansion - only then you'll earn the right to go to the Cinnabar Gym.

----------------
POKEMON MANSION:
----------------
Wild Pokemon: The mansion has 4 floors (1F, 2F, 3F, B1F). All floors contain *Koffing, Grimer, Rattata, Muk, and Weezing. Floor 1F-3F has Raticate while Floor B1F has it replaced by Ditto. Additionally, each floor has a different Fire-type Pokemon: 1F has Growlithe, 2F has Vulpix, 3F has *Ponyta, and B1F has *Magmar.

Thanks to the half-destroyed state of the mansion, you can't just grab things on each floor in order. You have to take a roundabout route.

1F: There are two trainers on this floor.
Youngster Johnson
Ekans LV 33 x2
Raticate LV 34

Scientist Ted
Electrode LV 29
Weezing LV 29

4 items:
Moon Stone: Hidden on the left side of the floor in the entrance hallway, in the small rock among a pile of rocks.
Escape Rope: Visible on a table in the top left room.
Carbos: Visible in the top right quadrant of the floor.
Protein: In the big room with stairs down, it's hidden in the top left corner. Can't be obtained right now.

2F: 2nd floor has two trainers as well.
Burglar Arnie
Charmander LV 34
Charmeleon LV 34

Scientist Braydon
Magnemite LV 33
Voltorb LV 33

3 items, all visible:
Calcium: In the room south from the stairs down.
Zinc: On a table in the top right room.
HP Up: In the broken doorway near to the right stairs up. Can't be obtained right now.

There are three stairs up on the floor. The lower stairs (the one next to stairs form 1F) lead to a separate area of 3F with an item (Iron) and a trainer. To get further, take the upper stairs.

3F: Once again, two trainers.
Burglar Simon
Ninetales LV 38

Burglar Lewis
Growlithe LV 34
Ponyta LV 34

4 items:
Iron: Visible on a table in the bottom left room.
Rare Candy: Hidden in a lone rock in the top right corner.
Max Potion: Visible in bottom right part of the room.
Max Revive: Hidden on the tile right below Max Potion.

Note that Ponyta can be caught on this floor.
An Iron is accessible from the first stairs, the other 3 items are in the main area of the floor. Get to the down stairs on the right and go back to 2F.

2F: Now you're in the right position to grab the HP Up and fight the 2nd trainer on this floor. There's a hole in a wall to the south. Ignore what the trainer says and fall into it.

1F: You can get the Protein now. Go to B1F.

B1F: One trainer in the top right room. 
Scientist Ivan
Magnemite LV 34
Electrode LV 34

In the room directly left of the stairs, interact with the device in the top left corner of the room to find an Elixer. In the top left room, there's a guy you have to talk to in order to complete this dungeon. In the room below him is TM22 (Solar Beam).

Note that this floor has Ditto and Magmar. Ditto is a Pokemon you especially should get because of its universal breeding compatibility. Since this floor is hard to access, you should catch what you want while you're still here.

Once you're done, go back up and out. There's an exit from the mansion south of the stairs.

With Ditto, you can now obtain some pre-evolutions (Pichu, Cleffa, and Igglybuff) if you weren't able to before. You are now also able to breed Magmar to get Magby.

Note that while Chansey also has a pre-evolution, you can't get the necessary item to get it just yet.

But what's more important, the ship can now take you to the Cinnabar Gym!

---------------------
BONUS: Catching Ho-Oh
---------------------
Since our journey takes us back to Viridian City now, let's try getting our first legendary, Ho-Oh!

Ho-Oh appears on Route 1 with 1% chance. It's at level 50. It's a normal encounter, so you can encounter it again even if you catch or defeat it.

To catch it in reasonable time, I'd suggest the following setup:

1. Buy some Max Repels and LOTS of Ultra Balls (although there will be better balls - Timer Balls - you can use to catch it later on if you don't mind waiting). The catch rate of Ho-Oh is very low.
Max Repels will be used to avoid encounters. The trick is that they only prevent encounters with Pokemon of lower level than the one in your first slot. If that Pokemon is at a reasonable level, BUT not greater than 50, Max Repel will avoid all standard Pokemon on Route 1, so you can only encounter Ho-Oh. You might walk a long time before that happens, but it's considerably quicker than fighting normal battles or escaping them.

2. Your leading Pokemon should be a Beedrill. That's because Beedrill has the Swarm ability which doubles encounter rate -- leads to less wasted Repels.

3. You need some source of paralysis to improve catch rate. Pikachu's Nuzzle is a good one, since you definitely have a Pikachu and since Nuzzle always causes paralysis. While sleep would improve catch rate more than paralysis, paralysis has the advantage of never wearing off.

4. You need something strong to beat Ho-Oh down -- I'll leave the choice to you. False Swipe (TM54) on a high-level Pokemon would be nice since it can't KO.

5. Before trying to find Ho-Oh, SAVE THE GAME. Even when you find Ho-Oh, it might still take multiple attempts, and even an unsuccessful attempt will cost you lots of valuable Ultra Balls. If you encounter Ho-Oh and fail to catch it, reload and try again.

Once you find Ho-Oh, Paralyze  it, reduce its HP and start chucking Ultra Balls. Ho-Oh has Safeguard, Calm Mind, Extrasensory and Recover, so if you use a Dark type pokemon it will not be able to deal any damage.

If you manage to get a Ho-Oh, congratulations! -- you got a powerful legendary and the rest of the game got easier.

--------------
VIRIDIAN CITY:
--------------
The old man who blocked the entrance to the Viridian Gym will now move away, letting you access it. The moment you enter it, you'll be thrown into battle with a L50 Mewtwo, so be prepared to catch it! While you can chuck Ultra Balls at it, I would suggest just using the Master Ball you got from Silph Co. There will be a few more Master Balls in future, plus, Mewtwo is the first Legendary in the game that actually blocks your progress, so you might not have as much time and resources to prepare for it as you want.

Once the battle is over, you go immediately into a battle with TR.
ICONIC BATTLE:
TR's Jessie and James
Kingler LV 40
Rhydon LV 40
Machamp LV 40
Arbok LV 37
Weezing LV 37

An exploit you could use to make the game ridiculously easy is that if you lose to TR, the events inside of the Viridian City gym restart, allowing you to get as many Mewtwos as you’d like.

Defeat them and the Gym collapses. You'll appear outside.

There's an item close to where you are. It's the Earth Badge, plus TM26 (Earthquake). In addition, you can go through the wreckage of the Gym to get a Lucky Egg, an extremely useful item that boosts EXP for any Pokemon that holds it.

Now that you have 8 badges, Poke Marts update their inventory for the last time:
Poke Ball - 200
Great Ball - 600
Ultra Ball - 1200
Potion - 300
Super Potion - 700
Hyper Potion - 1200
Max Potion - 2500

Full Heal - 600
Escape Rope - 550
Repel - 350
Super Repel - 500
Max Repel - 700

Before you head to Route 22, head back towards Pallet Town. There will be an ICONIC LV 5 Mr. Mime blocking the way. When you talk to it, you have the option of letting it join your team. Now head back to Viridian, and head west to route 22.

---------
ROUTE 22:
---------
Wild Pokemon: Persian, *Onix, Sandslash, *Machoke, Jigglypuff, Pidgeotto, Poliwhirl. Level 35-38.

There's Machoke, but no Machop. Machop can be found later. If you want, you can catch a Machoke here and breed it for Machop.

There are 9 trainers on this route. Several of them are based on the characters of the 1st Pokemon Movie, Mewtwo Strikes Back.

Once you get out, you can find several vendors.
Careful; you'll eventually lose access to Indigo Plateau, so you might want to buy something now.

Top left vendor sells:
Fresh Water - 200
Soda Pop - 300
Lemonade - 350
Berry Juice - 100

Top right vendor sells:
Full Incense - 5000
Lax Incense - 5000
Luck Incense - 11000
Odd Incense - 2000
Pure Incense - 6000
Rock Incense - 2000
Rose Incense - 2000
Sea Incense - 2000
Wave Incense - 2000

Bottom left vendor sells:
Cheri Berry - 20
Chesto Berry - 20
Pecha Berry - 20
Rawst Berry - 20
Aspear Berry - 20
Oran Berry - 20
Lum Berry - 20
Sitrus Berry - 20

And the bottom right vendor (TR) sells:
Cleanse Tag - 5000
Destiny Knot - 4000
EverStone - 2100
Poke Doll - 1000
Heart Scale - 100

What do these items actually do? Incenses have an effect in battle when held, but they are also necessary to obtain certain Pokemon. That's because they can help you get “baby pokemon”, which are the pre-evolutions of certain pokemon. If you want to learn more about them, I would recommend using Bulbapedia. At this point, the Luck Incense is the only one that can work for you: you can use it with Chansey to breed Happiny. The Luck Incense also doubles the amount of money you get from trainer battles, so it’s handy if you don’t have the Amulet Coin for some reason.
So, which Incenses do you actually need to buy now? Assuming you don't want their battle effects and just want to breed to get baby pokemon asap, Full, Luck, Rock, Odd and Sea Incense are most important, as you will have a chance to get these Pokemon in the not-too-distant future.
Lax Incense is just unnecessary to buy at all, as there will actually be a free one in the area where the relevant Pokemon appears for the first time. The Rose Incense is also unnecessary since you’ll first be able to get the baby form of the pokemon that can use it.
As for the Pure and Wave Incenses, by the time you actually get the Pokemon that use them, you'll have access to a permanent Incense shop, so there's no need to buy them here.

Note that if you get a Happiny, you won't be able to evolve it into a Chansey yet - this requires an Oval Stone; you don't have access to one yet.

Heart Scales are used with Move Relearner. They got much cheaper with the more recent generations, so that change has been reflected here.
Everstones have 2 effects - it stops evolution when held and forces a parent's nature onto a baby when breeding. Not too useful since you’ll be able to buy nature-changing items later on in the game.

There's still a lot of trainers to get money for the remaining items, but if you need more, there are a few options.

1. Meowth:
Meowth can learn an attack called "Pay Day". Whenever you use it, you get money equal to double Meowth's level at the end of the battle. Note that you must decline Meowth's evolution a few times to get it.
You can double the amount by using Amulet Coin or Luck Incense, but it's not really worth it -- even with Lv. 100 Meowth or Persian (which you're probably far from having), you'd only get 400 per Pay Day.
There's one more advantage of Meowth, though: it can have the ability Pickup and get you items as you walk.

2. Triple Triad at the Game Corner:
Ironically, you can make money at the Game Corner. More info can be found by using Ctrl + F and typing “Triad:” (with the colon).

3. Crime:
And by "crime", I mean TM46, Thief.
A few wild Pokemon can have items. Catching a Pokemon will give you the item, obviously, but that's not financially sound since you'd be down a cost of Pokeball and, more to the point, the items themselves might be rare. There is an ability, Frisk, that can tell you whether a Pokemon has an item or not, but unfortunately, you don't have access to it yet.
What you DO have access to, though, is Butterfree. Butterfree has the ability Compound Eyes that increases the chance you'll find a Pokemon with an item.

Next step is just to use Thief. Fortunately, Butterfree is able to learn it from the TM. Remember that Butterfree must not hold any item, otherwise the theft won't work.

An advanced setup is to have Butterfree in the front, but already fainted (its ability will still work like that), and a Pokemon with Frisk and Thief in the second spot. That way you'll get lots of items and you can steal them easily.

So, is there a good place to steal? Most items that can be obtained are not that expensive, but Mt. Moon is a pretty good one. It has two good money makers: Paras and Clefairy/Clefable (both have a greater chance to be encountered on the top floor).

Clefairy can hold a Moon Stone, which, apart from the fact that it's important for the evolution of several Pokemon lines, can be sold for 2000. Paras, on the other hand, can have either a Tiny Mushroom or a Big Mushroom. Tiny Mushrooms can be sold for 250, while Big Mushrooms can be sold for 2500! Compound Eyes make them appear 20% of the time, so it's a bit time-intensive but potentially profitable.

Alternatively, you might want to try Hidden Village. There are wild Paras here as well, but you can also find Staryu -- and Staryu can have Stardust or Star Piece. Even common Stardust can be sold for 1000 and Star Piece for even more money. Unfortunately, Staryu are pretty rare.

Basically: if you want to gather some Moon Stones for evolution, hit Mt. Moon -- otherwise, Hidden Village might be better.

As a note: there's one more item a Paras might have: Balm Mushroom. That can be sold for an incredible 25,000, but it's rare, even with Compound Eyes.

As for farming specific items for their USE, I'd suggest waiting until you get Frisk.
But we'll have time for this after we go through Pokemon League!

Enter the building in the Indigo Plateau.

On your left is a woman who lets you enter the league. At the left wall is a Poke Mart, and at the top right is a Pokemon Centre. After registration, you can go to the Water stage, the second exit from right.
ICONIC LEAGUE BATTLE:

After you beat Brock, you can continue with the Indigo League -- this time on the Grass stage, the rightmost exit, facing the fourth trainer.
ICONIC LEAGUE BATTLE:
Aroma Lady Jeanette (3v3)
Beedrill LV 44
Scyther LV 44

The fifth and final Trainer, Ritchie, is up next. And you get the right to fight in the Indigo Stadium -- left exit.
ICONIC LEAGUE BATTLE:
Picnicker Ritchie (3v3)
Butterfree LV 45 (Happy)
Pikachu LV 45 (Sparky)

And that's it! You got to Top 16, and that's the best you can get for now. As you finish, the announcer tells you to go tell Professor Oak how you did. So let's head back to Pallet Town now

------------
PALLET TOWN:
------------
Return home and talk to Professor Oak. He'll let you travel to the Orange Archipelago on a blimp... that is, if a Fearow didn't attack the blimps! The Fearow hides in the northern part of the Viridian Forest, but beware -- once you beat it, the Indigo Plateau closes for a long time and you'll lose access to the shops there. So if you want to use them, now's your chance!

Once you're good, beat the Fearow - it is only level 40, so you should have no problem with it.

We can now move further, but before that, go back to Pallet Town. In the SE corner of town will be a pink-haired girl who will give you LV 50 Mew. The girl is actually Mew in disguise. Don't judge.

In addition, go to your house and to your room upstairs. Get the item that appeared there, TM102 (Crush Claw).

Nothing else to do -- go to Viridian City and use the blimp service to go to Valencia Island.


-------------------------------------------
START OF GENERATION 1.5: THE ORANGE ISLANDS

On the blimp, you'll be ambushed by TR.
ICONIC BATTLE

Arbok LV 38

But after you defeat them, you'll end up crashing on Valencia Island... well, at least you got there!

Wild Pokemon: Butterfree, NidoranF, NidoranM, Paras, Raticate, Vileplume, Weepinbell. Level 33-37.
Cloyster can be caught here, even with Old Rod, but you might want to wait and get a Shellder later.

NE from where you land, there's a visible item (Berry Juice). When you go north, you'll find a Great Ball on the northern end of the western beach.

Enter Professor Ivy's lab and grab the GS Ball.

Now that you have it, several things happen:
1. You can move between your house in Pallet Town and Professor Ivy's lab using the warps that are located there. More destinations will be added to the warps as you unlock new regions.
2. The blimp in Viridian City will now take you to the civilized part of Valencia Island.
3. The middle ship in Vermilion City (the one you used to go to Cinnabar Island) now connects to Valencia Island as well.
4. A sailor with his Lapras appears on the western beach of Valencia Island. This will be your way of getting around the Orange Islands. The sailor can also take you to Vermilion City or to two new destinations: Tangelo Island and Mikan Island. Let’s go to Tangelo Island first.

---------------
TANGELO ISLAND:
---------------
A few things to do here:

This is the first place that you can catch Tentacool, even with Old Rod. The other Pokemon available from fishing is Slowpoke.

The house right next to where you start has a lady who gives you a Max Revive.

One of the houses in SW corner (only one can be entered) has Pokemon Move Maniac who can teach your Pokemon any moves they could've learnt at a previous level. He only requires 1 Heart Scale per move, which is pretty cheap.

Pokemon Park isn't too useful, just pretty. House in the SE corner can't actually be entered.

The important thing here is in the NE corner. Four trainers block your way to a Lapras.

Once you beat them, talk to the ICONIC LV 40 Lapras in order to obtain it. Directly south of it, you can also get TM133 (Surf).

That's all here, let's go to Mikan Island now.

-------------
MIKAN ISLAND:
-------------
Fishing: Horsea and Staryu.

Close to where you start is a house. In the tree left of the house is a hidden Pecha Berry.
At the SE corner of the island is a Revive. Below that is a guy who gives you TM25 (Thunder).
A house on the hill in the center of the island has a trainer. After you beat him, talk to him to get TM42 (Facade).

Once you've beaten her, the guy in the eastern house will now give you a Water Stone. You can also get TM42 if you haven't done so yet - you don't have to fight the trainer anymore.

Lastly, Lapras Launch lets you go to Navel Island.

-------------
NAVEL ISLAND:
-------------
Fishing: Magikarp and *Seel.

You start on a beach. In the NE tile of this beach is a hidden Heart Scale.

A guy directly south of the Pokemon Centre will give you TM83 (Work Up) and inside the Pokemon Centre another guy will give you a Soft Sand.

The right house contains four guys. Three of them are move tutors for: Fire Punch, Ice Punch, and Thunder Punch.

After that, go to the cave up north. Welcome to Navel Rock.

-----------
NAVEL ROCK:
-----------
Navel Rock has four floors: 1F, B1F, 2F, and 3F. 1F and 2F share the same Pokemon list, as do B1F and 3F. Possible Pokemon are:
*Cubone - 1F and 2F only, common
Abra - B1F and 3F only, common
*Electabuzz - common on 1F and 2F, rare on B1F and 3F
Graveler - common on B1F and 3F, rare on 1F and 2F
Dugtrio - uncommon on all floors
*Diglett - uncommon on all floors
*Machop - uncommon on all floors
Ekans - uncommon on all floors
Golbat - uncommon on all floors
Zubat - rare on all floors
Koffing - very rare on all floors
*Voltorb - very rare on all floors

If you get an Electabuzz, remember that you can breed it to get an Elekid.

So, what about Voltorb? It has a 1% encounter rate, and even if encountered, it unfortunately knows Self-Destruct, so it can blow itself up. And your next chance to get one will come quite a bit later. To improve your chances, you should get a Poliwag or its evolution with the ability Damp which will cause Self-Destruct to fail. Unfortunately, they have to be pretty high-leveled so that Voltorb can't just OHKO them with its OTHER attacks... or if you want to avoid that, you could wait until you can catch a Water/Ground type with the ability Damp. Supposedly, you could improve your chances of finding a Voltorb (well, that, or Electabuzz) by using a Pokemon with Static in the front, but from my testing, this doesn't seem to really work.

Anyway, once you're ready to do this dungeon, go up then left. Fight a trainer and get down the ladder.

-------------------------
SEVEN GRAPEFRUIT ISLANDS:
-------------------------
Fishing: Goldeen + Staryu.

This place is a bit confusing: as the name says, there are seven islands which are connected by bridges into a long linear sequence. Let's call the island you start on Island 3. The island north of you is Island 2, and the island to the east of THAT is Island 1. Islands 4-7 are those you can get to by going south, in order.

Island 1:
Bunch of guys picking grapefruits. The mid-bottom guy on the right side will give you TM105 (Toxic Spikes).

Island 2:
You can get an item here (Berry Juice).

Island 3:
Nothing interesting, except for the Lapras Launch to go back to Navel Island.

Island 4:
A woman in the house here will tell you about the Snorlax problem. Since you want to go deal with it, she will let the guard know.
A guy in the Pokemon Centre will give you a Berry Juice.

Island 5:
This island is completely devastated by Snorlax. There are some green-ish patches left, and two of them contain hidden Berry Juices: the one at the very NE, and one roughly in the middle: go east from the bridge and it should be the second patch you see.

Island 6:
More devastation. There's one hidden Berry Juice, in a green-ish patch: go east from the bridge, go down from the first patch and search the second one.

Island 7:
You must talk to the woman in the house on Island 4 in order to get here. There's an ICONIC Snorlax here (level 45).

Go back to Island 4 and talk to the woman again -- you will get Leftovers.

If you have bought the Incenses at Indigo Plateau, you can give Full Incense to Snorlax and breed it to get a Munchlax.

You can now use the Lapras Launch to reach the next island, Trovita Island.

---------------
TROVITA ISLAND:
---------------
While it's possible to fish here, no encounters are defined and so you can't catch anything.

On the west side of the island, there is a Move Tutor for Endeavor. Nothing else to do here. Lorelei from Elite Four is in front of the gym and you have to fight her to get into the gym.

Note that this is a premium leveling spot -- not only are the Pokemon high-leveled, but they are also all evolved forms which give significantly more EXP! With a Lucky Egg and an Exp. Share, you can get a lot here.

Defeating Drake now lets you go from Pummelo Island to the Element Islands. There are a few more things, but you should go to the Element Islands first, if you want some legendary pokemon.

----------------
ELEMENT ISLANDS:
----------------
Weather forecast: Stormy

There are three islands - Ice, Lightning, and Fire. You start at the Ice island and Lapras Launch can transport you to other islands as well as back to Pummelo Island. Ice island has Articuno on it, Lightning island has Zapdos, and Fire Island has Moltres.

All three are level 50. You could get them now, or wait until you can get specialised balls to catch them. I recommend using Fast Balls on Zapdos (since it's fast), and Timer Balls on the other 2. Bear in mind that all 3 of them have Roost for healing.

And we're done with the Orange Islands! Next up, Johto!

Go to Ivy’s lab in Valencia Island and teleport home to Pallet Town.

------------
PALLET TOWN:
------------
Go to Professor Oak's Lab. Gary blocks the stairs; waste him.
ICONIC BATTLE
Rival Gary
Eevee LV 50

Talk to Professor Oak in his lab and we're officially on the road to Johto. Go to Indigo Plateau; the western exit from the gate building will be open now.


---------------------------------------
START OF GENERATION 2: THE JOHTO REGION
---------------------------------------

---------
ROUTE 45:
---------
The way west is blocked by a pair of fighting trainers. Follow the path south.

--------------
NEW BARK TOWN:
--------------
Go to Professor Elm's Lab in the NW corner. There's a teleport in his lab which connects to the other two (Pallet Town and Valencia Island). You can now teleport freely between the three regions.

Go west to route 29.

---------
ROUTE 29:
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Heracross, *Spinarak, Pinsir, Butterfree, *Stantler, NidoranF, NidoranM. Usual level 5-6.

Since you're in a new region, wild Pokemon levels dropped significantly. Use False Swipe so your high-level Pokemon won't knock the wild Pokemon out. You should have a TM for it -- or at the very least, Cubone has it naturally.

The most important thing here is Stantler. Try to get a Stantler with a Frisk ability -- fortunately, its second ability is Intimidate which shows itself in battle. If you meet a Stantler and it won't reduce your attack, it probably has Frisk and you should get it.

Frisk will reveal an item held by opposing Pokemon (if any) once you encounter it. Combined with Butterfree's Compound Eyes (which, as I've said before, increase the chance of meeting Pokemon with items), you will get a powerful team for item farming (don't forget to teach Thief to your Stantler).
For maximum speed, you can make your Butterfree faint. That way, Compound Eyes will still work but Stantler will enter the battle first so you don't have to switch it in (after all, if you start with Butterfree, you can just have THAT use Thief). Or you can just give Stantler a Smoke Ball and immediately run from anything uninteresting (of course, then you need someone else with Thief to actually steal the item). Also, if you're doing this, have some items ready to heal your Stantler -- using a Pokemon Centre would revive Butterfree and you'd have to make it faint again.

The first thing you'll notice in this route is an ICONIC LV 6 Heracross to the north of you. Talk to it to have it join your team. In the NE corner of the route, there is a Potion. Midway along the route you'll get to amuse yourself by crushing the dreams of a beginning trainer and baseball fangirl Casey.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pickincker Casey
Chikorita LV 4
Pidgey LV 3
Rattata LV 3

After you stomp her, talk to the Chikorita on this Route. It will run away into the northern part of the route. Follow it to the snowy forest. You can catch a *Hoothoot here (Haunters and Gengars rarely appear as well). You shouldn't use False Swipe here -- this location has permanent hail and Hoothoot will be KO'd by the hail. Instead wait a bit until its HP has dropped and then catch it. Or use Sunny Day/Rain Dance to change the weather so that it doesn’t take damage and then use False Swipe.

There are a pair of trainers at the entrance of the snowy area.
MINOR ICONIC
Channeler Hagatha & Channeler Nagatha
Hoothoot LV 5 x2

Talk to the ICONIC LV 5 Chikorita again and you can grab it for yourself!

After returning to the main route and continuing west, you'll pass another trainer.
MINOR ICONIC
Lady Rochelle
Donphan LV 2 x4

Continue west to Cherrygrove City.

-----------------
CHERRYGROVE CITY:
-----------------
Nothing too important here, except fishing -- Woopers can be caught in this town. There is a new teleporter in Pokemon Centre, but we can't use her services yet.

There's also a Move tutor here out by the beach that will teach your Pokemon the move Gravity and another person who will tell you how trade evolutions in Fire Ash work, but this guy also tells you about trade evolutions of Gen 2 pokemon.

Before we go further...

STOP AND FRISK SECTION:
a.k.a. Thievery for fun and profit.

With the combination of Compound Eyes and Frisk, you have a good chance to grab some new items. Technically, you could have gotten them before, but Frisk makes it less time-consuming.

What can we get at this point in the game and where can we get it?

Sidenote: You'll be able to buy the items in sections 1 + 2 eventually, and you'll get the items in section 3 throughout the game, so you don't have to steal them from wild pokemon. Only do so if you want them now.

Once you get what you want, continue north from Cherrygrove City to Route 30.

---------
ROUTE 30:
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Ledyba, Hoothoot, Spinarak, Caterpie, Weedle, Metapod, Kakuna, Pidgey. Level 7-8.

Three visible items on the path, a Potion, an Antidote and a Poke Ball.

Next to a house is an Apricorn tree which will give you a random Apricorn.

There are a total of 5 trainers on the route. Two of them are in the eastern grassy section.
MINOR ICONIC
Pokemon Ranger Bailey
Bellossom LV 6 x2 (Belle & Bella)

MINOR ICONIC
Lass Arielle
Ledyba LV 4 x6

The other side of the route has 2 others.
Youngster Joe

Youngster Mikey
Pidgey LV 6
Rattata LV 7

At the top of the route there is another trainer.
MINOR ICONIC
Lady Muchmoney
Snubbull LV 7

At the end of the route is a gate. Continue west to Violet City.

------------
VIOLET CITY:
------------
Fishing: Magikarp and *Marill.
If you have a Sea Incense, you can breed Marill to get Azurill.

There's a Potion north of where you come in. You have to go around the Pokemon Centre to reach it.
There's another Apricorn Tree in the SW part of the city.
There's a hidden Poke Ball in the NW corner of the island in the lake.

The school (house north of the Pokecenter) has a trainer inside.
MINOR ICONIC
Youngster Zackie
Bellsprout LV 8

The NW house has a guy who wants to trade your Bellsprout for his Onix.

The gym has two trainers and Falkner.
Bird Keeper Abe
Spearow LV 11
 
Bird Keeper Rod
Pidgey LV 9 x2

However, Falkner won't fight you because there’s something going on at the Sprout Tower. Go there and you'll fight TR again.
ICONIC BATTLE
TR's Jessie and James
Arbok LV 40
Lickitung LV 38
Victreebel LV 38
Weezing LV 40

There are two old guys at the top. Talk to the left one to fight him and get TM70 (Flash) as a reward.
Gentleman Li
Bellsprout LV 12

Now you can fight Falkner.
ICONIC BATTLE
GYM LEADER FALKNER (3v3)
Hoothoot LV 11
Dodrio LV 13
Pidgeot LV 13

Beat him for Zephyr Badge and TM40 (Aerial Ace).

Like Kanto, Johto features a system where you can teleport from a town with a pokemon centre to another. Now that you’ve beaten Falkner, the Johto Teleport System starts to work now, connecting Cherrygrove City and Violet City.

There are two routes leading from Violet City: Route 32 to the south and Route 36 through the gate building to the west. Let's start west.

---------
ROUTE 36:
---------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, Hoothoot, NidoranF, NidoranM, Vulpix, Growlithe, Stantler (rare). Level 6-11.

There is a trainer here in the northern grass patch.
MINOR ICONIC
Lass Wilhomena
Marill LV 10

The way west is blocked. However, we can still visit the Ruins of Alph to the south.

--------------
RUINS OF ALPH:
--------------
Outside of the ruins itself is a Move Tutor for Wonder Room.

The cave contains nothing but Unown (Level 11). There are four items -- Leppa Berry is left from the entrance, the other 3 (Stardust, Great Ball, and TM16 (Lunge)) are on the linear path through the ruins.

I suggest having an empty spot in your party. Catch one extra Unown, put it in the front spot and give it to the man in the house next to the ruins to obtain a Psychic Gem.

That's all we can do here for now (though you might want to search the ruins for a while to register all 28 forms of Unown into your Pokedex -- no need to catch or even defeat them, you just have to meet them), so return to Violet City and go south to Route 32.

---------
ROUTE 32:
---------
Wild Pokemon: Hoothoot, *Mareep, *Sentret, Oddish, Diglett, Gloom, Primeape, Machoke, *Hitmonlee, *Hitmonchan, Vileplume. Level 8-10.
Fishing: Magikarp and Goldeen.

Many new Pokemon here. Note that you can breed Hitmonlee or Hitmonchan with Ditto to obtain Tyrogue, who you can then evolve into Hitmontop. That requires its ATK and DEF to be the same, so it might require some finagling.

Talk to the first guy you meet to obtain a Miracle Seed. Fight three trainers.

MINOR ICONIC

Then there will be a big patch of tall grass on the left. A Super Potion is hidden on the only non-grass tile inside.

A Great Ball is hidden on the tile just in front of the cave entrance.

Enter the cave (Charicific Valley). You won't be allowed to pass unless you have a Charizard with you. If you do, the woman will fight you.
MINOR ICONIC
Cool Trainer Liza
Charizard LV 50 (Charla)

After you beat her, she'll join the ranks of the Day Care trainers. In the back of the cave, among the Charizards, is TM43 (Flame Charge).
After that, Route 32 splits a bit. Left path (over land) contains a trainer and ends with a Great Ball.
Lass Mary
Mareep LV 12 (Fluffy)

The right part (The bridge) starts with a guy who gives you a Heart Scale and continues with three trainers.
Fisherman Henry
Poliwag LV 10 x2

Fisherman Justin
Magikarp LV 17

Fisherman Ralph
Goldeen LV 12

Then two more trainers and you're done with this route.
ICONIC BATTLE
Super Nerd Shingo
Scizor LV 14 (Blade)

Bird Keeper Peter
Pidgey LV 9
Pidgey LV 10
Spearow LV 10

Continue south to Route 33.

---------
ROUTE 33:
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Pineco, Mareep, Sentret, Oddish, Hoothoot, Diglett. Level 11-16.

Go to the right. You'll find an ICONIC LV 10 Cyndaquil that’s being guarded by a trainer. Fight him and take Cyndaquil with you.
ICONIC BATTLE
Tamer Koji
Sandslash LV 15

Continue west to the Azalea Town.

------------
AZALEA TOWN:
------------
West of the house with a yellow roof and a chimney is a Full Heal hidden in a rock. You can talk to the guy inside of the house for a Charcoal.

A man in PokeMart will give you a Blue Apricorn.

There's also Slowpoke Well here, which is exactly what it says -- a small cave with nothing but Slowpokes inside. If you want more Lagging Tails for some reason, this is the best place to farm them.

In the NW corner is Kurt's house. There's another Apricorn tree there. Unfortunately you can't get inside because Brock blocks the door. Fight him and he'll move.
ICONIC BATTLE
Breeder Brock
Onix LV 45
Geodude LV 43
Vulpix LV 42
Zubat LV 41
Pineco LV 16

Go inside and talk to Kurt. Give him your GS Ball and you'll get a Lure Ball and a Fast Ball in return.
You can now give Apricorns to Kurt and he'll make special Pokeballs from them:
Black Apricorn -> Heavy Ball
Blue Apricorn -> Lure Ball
Green Apricorn -> Friend Ball
Pink Apricorn -> Love Ball
Red Apricorn -> Level Ball 
White Apricorn -> Fast Ball
Yellow Apricorn -> Moon Ball

Of course, you will eventually encounter a shop that sells these types of Poke Balls without going through any of that "once per day" thing. And they are actually pretty cheap. So yeah, Kurt’s pretty useless.

Go to the gym. It has 4 trainers plus Bugsy.
Bug Catcher Al
Caterpie LV 14
Weedle LV 14

Bug Catcher Josh
Paras LV 14

Bug Catcher Benny
Weedle LV 10
Beedrill LV 14
Kakuna LV 12

Ledyba LV 13
Spinarak LV 13

ICONIC BATTLE
GYM LEADER BUGSY (3v3)
Spinarak LV 16
Scyther LV 19
Metapod LV 16

Beat him for the Hive Badge and TM81 (X-Scissor). Azalea Town will be connected to the Johto teleport system.

Once you do both quests in this town (Gym and GS Ball handoff), you can leave through the western exit to Ilex Forest.

-----------------------
ILEX FOREST (1st Part):
-----------------------
Wild Pokemon: *Farfetch'd, *Snubbull, Hoothoot, Pidgey, *Houndour, Beedrill, *Eevee, Onix, Noctowl, Ursaring. Level 13-17.

Note Eevee, especially. You probably have, or can grab, evolution stones to get Vaporeon, Jolteon, and Flareon.
Espeon and Umbreon require happiness and Eevee needs to be levelled up at day or night respectively.
There are 2 ways to get Leafeon: Use a Leaf Stone on Eevee, or level Eevee up near a Mossy Rock. The first Mossy Rock is in Hoenn, so use a Leaf Stone if you want Leafeon now.
There are also 2 ways to get Glaceon (like Leafeon): Use an Ice Stone on Eevee, or level Eevee up near an Icy Rock. Unlike Leafeon however, you can't obtain it right now since you can't actually buy Ice Stones until you get to Sinnoh. Coincidentally, the first Ice Rock location is in Sinnoh so either way you'll have to wait until you can get Glaceon.
For Sylveon, you need high friendship and a Fairy type move. This will have priority over Espeon and Umbreon, so if you want either of them, make sure your Eevee doesn’t have any Fairy type moves.

Also note that Farfetch'd can have Leek -- try to get one from them for your own Farfetch'd!

Go and fight the first trainer.
Bug Catcher Wayne
Paras LV 15
Ledyba LV 15

At the fork, go right. There's another trainer and a Revive.
MINOR ICONIC
Youngster Sylvester
Farfetch'd LV 17

Go to the left and grab a Full Heal hidden on the second empty tile from the left inside a grass patch. Continue past another trainer.
MINOR ICONIC
Cool Trainer Miki
Skarmory LV 17

Then grab a visible item (Soothe Bell). Continue south and west to Pokemon Swap Meet.

------------------
POKEMON SWAP MEET:
------------------
You start next to an Apricorn Shop. It sells:
Red Apricorn - 100
Blue Apricorn - 100
Yellow Apricorn - 100
Green Apricorn - 100
Pink Apricorn - 100
White Apricorn - 100
Black Apricorn - 100

Along the path is:

A Pokemon Centre -- nothing too interesting. It's not even a part of the teleport system, but at least you can fly there.

A guy who will battle you if you have a Tauros as your front Pokemon.
MINOR ICONIC
Cool Trainer Fernando
Tauros LV 45

When you beat him, he will give you a Life Orb. Afterwards, he'll offer to trade your Tauros for his Nidoqueen.

Sidenote: The Life Orb has been fixed as of 3.0 - the recoil for using it is now around 1/10th of your Pokemon's HP rather than just 1 HP like it used to be.

Next is a girl who offers to trade your Corsola for her Lickitung.

Next is another vendor:
Fresh Water - 200
Soda Pop - 300
Lemonade - 350
Berry Juice - 100

Probably moved here from the Indigo Plateau...

Near the fountain are two more traders: one trades your Tauros for their Rhyhorn, and the other trades your Ninetales for their Porygon (chance for those of you who didn't feel like grinding 9999 coins).

On the right is another vendor with Indigo Plateau goods:
Cheri Berry - 20
Chesto Berry - 20
Pecha Berry - 20
Rawst Berry - 20
Aspear Berry - 20
Oran Berry - 20
Lum Berry - 20
Sitrus Berry - 20

And further right is a guy who trades your Butterfree for his Bellossom.

The NW part has two more traders: your Teddiursa for his Igglybuff and your Mankey for her Aipom.

There's also a Biker Move Tutor who can teach your Pokemon the move Roost.

Aidan is at the burning house in NW corner (don't worry, it's just a drill). If you have a Squirtle, Wartortle, or Blastoise with you, he will let you train your Pokemon, either here or at his home on Ascorbia Island. Like with Anthony, the Pokemon deposited at one location can be picked up at another.

This is all here (no Incense shop, sadly). Continue NE to the next part of Ilex Forest.

-----------------------
ILEX FOREST (2nd Part):
-----------------------
Near the start, you'll encounter Misty again and fight her.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Misty
Staryu LV 46
Poliwhirl LV 20
Togepi LV 17

Once you defeat her, you'll meet the ICONIC LV 15 Totodile -- another gift pokemon. This one even comes in a fancy Lure Ball!

Head on up the path and choose the north branch, past another trainer.
MINOR ICONIC
Painter Trixie
Azumarill LV 14
Pidgey LV 14 x2
Marill LV 14
Golduck LV 14
Machoke LV 14

Continue along the path. There's a dead end with a trainer.
Bug Catcher Henery
Hoothoot LV 17

Beyond him, there's yet ANOTHER gift pokemon. This time it's Ash's famous ICONIC LV 18 Noctowl. It even has a nice shine to it!

Next, head back to the main path and grab an item along the way (Big Mushroom). There is a Move Tutor standing by the gate that can teach your Pokemon Headbutt.

Head through the gate house to Route 34.

---------
ROUTE 34:
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Girafarig, Sandshrew, Sentret, Paras, Voltorb, Oddish, Exeggcute, Slowpoke, Gloom, Fearow. Level 15-17.
Fishing: Krabby and Staryu.

Note: Girafarigs may have a Persim Berry, you might want to get some for your collection.

There are 7 trainers on this route.

The patch of grass on the right of where you enter has a hidden Super Potion in the NW corner.

In the big grass patch on the left is a girl who will give you a Water Stone.

Close to the fence, there's an empty tile in the grass. It hides a Rare Candy.

The last grass patch has a visible Nugget.

Continue north to Goldenrod City.

---------------
GOLDENROD CITY:
---------------
This is a big city with lots to do.

The house on the east side of the city has a Stats Judge who will tell you some vague data about the stats of your Pokemon. Considering how you can view your Pokemons' IVs when you're viewing their stats, he's not all too useful. Note that as of game version 3.2 his functions have been removed.

Go to the Bike Shop. The guy inside will give you TM36 (Sludge Bomb).

A Move Tutor west of the Game Corner will teach your Pokemon Snatch.

DJ Mary in the Radio Tower will give you Mystic Water.

The house in the NW part of the city has another Name Rater.

The house next to the Gym is a flower shop, selling:
Growth Mulch - 200
Damp Mulch - 200
Stable Mulch - 200
Gooey Mulch - 200

There is a tunnel connecting the north and south part of the city. 4 trainers are inside. From top to bottom, the are: 
Super Nerd Teru
Magnemite LV 15 x3
Voltorb LV 18

Pokemon Maniac Issac
Lickitung LV 17

Pokemon Maniac Donald
Slowpoke LV 16 x2

Super Nerd Eric
Grimer LV 16 x2

In a side branch is a Revive, and right left to it, a hidden Max Ether.
There is a Game Corner here, like in Celadon City. Its Pokemon are:
Igglybuff - 180 coins
Cleffa - 500 coins
*Larvitar - 2800 coins
*Gligar - 5500 coins
*Wobbuffet - 9999 coins

There will eventually be a gift Wynaut, so you don't have to get a Wobbuffet here. Larvitar and Gligar are also catchable later; however, Gligar won't be catchable until 4th generation, so you might want to get one.

Next is the Department Store. It's similar to the one in Saffron City.

2F: A girl here will give you TM98 (Drill Peck).

Top cashier sells:
Hyper Potion - 1200
Max Potion - 2500
Full Restore - 3000
Revive - 2000
Full Heal - 600

Bottom cashier sells:
Poke Ball - 200
Great Ball - 600
Ultra Ball - 1200
Full Heal - 600
Escape Rope - 550
Max Repel - 700

3F: A girl behind the counter is a Move Tutor for Bind.

4F: A man will give you a free Dusk Stone.

The cashier here sells:
Poke Doll - 1000
Fire Stone - 2100
Thunder Stone - 2100
Water Stone - 2100
Leaf Stone - 2100
Sun Stone - 2100

5F: Two cashiers here. The top one sells:
HP Up - 9800
Protein - 9800
Iron - 9800
Calcium - 9800
Zinc - 9800
Carbos - 9800

Bottom one sells:
X Attack - 500
X Defense - 550
X Speed - 350
X Sp.Atk - 350
X Sp.Def - 350
X Accuracy - 950
Guard Spec - 700
Dire Hit - 650

And that's all! The only thing to do is to hit the Gym. It contains 4 trainers plus Whitney.

After you beat her, she'll tell you to meet her out on Route 35, so let's head north out of Goldenrod City.

---------
ROUTE 35:
---------
Wild Pokemon: Pidgey, NidoranF, *Yanma, NidoranM, Abra, Drowzee, Ditto, Hoothoot. Level 14-20.
Note that Yanma can hold a new item, Wide Lens -- you might want to grab one. But you have to go past 6 of the 8 trainers here to even get to some grass!

Beat the first trainer on the route.
Picnicker Kim
Vulpix LV 21

The way is now clear to face Whitney for a second time.

ICONIC BATTLE
GYM LEADER WHITNEY Round 2 (3v1, her Miltank against three of your pokemon)
Miltank LV 25

Once you beat her, you'll get the Plain Badge and TM45 (Attract). Goldenrod City will be added to the Johto teleport system, but more importantly, the Magnet Train will now let you travel between Goldenrod City and Saffron City! This cuts travel time between regions considerably since you no longer have to walk over the Pokemon-infested route between New Bark Town and Cherrygrove City.

Finally, the guy on Route 36 FINALLY found his Pokeball and no longer blocks the route, so technically you could skip the rest of the trainers on Route 35 - but where’s the fun in that?

Continue on up through Route 35, beating trainers as you go.

On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday the Bug-catching contest takes place. You enter the Park with a single Pokemon and use Sport Balls to catch various Bug types. Note that you might try to get a Shed Shell from Venomoths here. If you win, you get a random evolution stone. This can be:
Fire Stone, Thunder Stone, Water Stone, Leaf Stone, or Sun Stone (we can already buy those).
Moon Stone (we can steal these from Clefairy and Clefable).
Dusk Stone, Dawn Stone, Shiny Stone, Oval Stone (we can't buy these yet; note that Oval Stone is necessary to evolve Happiny, if you got one).

Second prize is Everstone, third prize Sitrus Berry, and the consolation prize is Shed Shell.

In the north Pavillion is Casey, who will fight you again.

First things first, there are three hidden items: a Hyper Potion between purple flowers, one tile NW from the signpost with the city name, an Ultra Ball in the flower box next to a house to the north of that, and a Rare Candy between two purple flowers by the pond.

The Kimono Dance Theatre (the house with a sign next to it) contains five battles against five trainers once you step inside.MINOR ICONIC SET

The third item is a HP up, hidden in the tile next to the red flower to the left of the pond.

Continue west to Route 39.

The fenced area contains two hidden items. Their location is hard to describe (you might want to use the Itemfinder here), but I'll try:

To find the first item, line yourself horizontally with the right edge of the grass patch to the south. The line yourself vertically with the top right flower in the meadow to the right. You are now standing one tile south of the item (X Attack).

The second item is three tiles southwest from the first item. It's a PP Up.

Apart from these two hidden items, there's also a visible item in the grass patch further south. It's a Nugget.

In the NW corner of the route is a house. Once you enter, you have to beat five trainers inside in order to get to the prize (a King's Rock). You are suggested to bring a heavy Pokemon. The heaviest Pokemon that you can have at this point is a Snorlax (460.0 kg), which is what Ash chooses to use in the anime. Second best choice is Steelix (if you have stolen some Metal Coats and evolved an Onix) with 400.0 kg, and third best choice is Golem (300.0 kg). It will somewhat help against Heavy Slams you'll face here, but it's far from necessary.

A guy in a house in the NE corner will trade your Krabby for his Voltorb. In the dead end to the right of it, there is a hidden Rare Candy.

A girl at the south edge of the town will give you a Soothe Bell. This item increases happiness when a Pokemon holds it -- you can use it to more easily achieve happiness evolutions.

A Move Tutor for Rollout is in the house west of the Pokemon Centre.

The Gym is inaccessible, so go to the Glitter Lighthouse in the SE corner of the city.

Once you talk to Jasmine, the ship in the harbor will take you to Cianwood City!

--------------
CIANWOOD CITY:
--------------
Fishing: Poliwag and Shellder.

There is a move tutor for Earth Power northwest of where you land.
Two of the rocks here contain hidden items:
Go north from where you landed, then left when you hit the sea. First rock you pass directly next contains a Max Ether. Then go to the very north of the city. There are four rocks on a ledge. A Revive is hidden in the second rock from the left.

A house with a sign is a Pharmacy. Talk to the clerk to send medicine to Jasmine's Ampharos. You can also buy stuff here:
Energy Powder - 500
HealPowder - 450
Energy Root - 800
Revival Herb - 2800
Poke Ball - 200

Herbs are powerful, but they decrease the happiness of Pokemon you use them on, so bear that in mind.

Well, the ship has conveniently broken down and not even the teleport in the Pokemon Centre works. We'll have to hit the gym.

After you beat him, TR will leave, letting you meet, fight, and capture Lugia. Be sure to save the game first. It's only level 35 while previous legendaries were 50, so it will be a bit easier. However, it does have Safeguard, which means that you won't be able to paralyze it, put it to sleep, etc.

Note: If you want catching Lugia even easier, wait until you get access to specialised balls. I recommend using Heavy Balls if you decide to wait.

There are several new things now. For one, you can go back to Olivine City by going back to Red Rock Isle then taking the other boat. The same boat will also now connect to Cianwood City, Red Rock Isle, and Vermilion City (and the ship in Vermilion City that goes to Cinnabar Island and Valencia Island will now travel to Olivine City as well).

But more importantly, the next part of the Safari Zone is unlocked!

------------------
SAFARI ZONE JOHTO:
------------------
The top right exit from the main Safari Zone is now open.

Wild Pokemon: Elekid, Magby, *Smoochum, Houndour, Mareep, *Shuckle, Jumpluff, Murkrow, Furret, Larvitar, *Misdreavus (rare), Wobbuffet (rare). Level 30-38.
Fishing: Wooper and *Chinchou.

We never found Jynx, so this is the first encounter with that family. Elekid and Magby are new if you haven't bred Electabuzz and Magmar. Lots of Pokemon to catch, at any rate.

There are also 3 items here - a Zinc, a Thunder Stone and a hidden Nugget. To find the Nugget, start by going 2 steps to the right and 4 steps up from the top right corner of the 2x2 square of sand on the left side of the area. It will be in the tile in front of you.

Once you're done, return to Olivine City. Both Olivine City and Cianwood City are now accessible through Johto teleport system.

Note that they are level 35 and Raikou and Entei have Roar -- you need a Pokemon with level higher than 35, otherwise they can kick you out of the battle. Although you can catch them now, I would recommend waiting until you can get access to specialised balls. Fast Balls should be used for Raikou and Entei, and Net Balls for Suicune.

Whether you decide to catch them or not, continue east to Route 42, fighting the trainer that now guards the entrance.

Note that the only grass patch is almost at the end of the route. Kangaskhan is the only new Pokemon here, but you might want to grab a Tyrogue if you haven't bred your own yet.

First of all, grab a Max Potion hidden in a boulder north of you. Then talk to the gentleman; he will give you an ICONIC Phanpy egg (it will hatch pretty quickly, too).

There's also a Day Care here, mysteriously connected to all other Pokemon training spots.

And that's it for Johto! We've passed through Gen 2!

-----------------
JOHTO ITEM CHECK:
-----------------
This seems like a good time to update the item farming guide now that we have access to all Johto areas.

Sidenote: You'll be able to buy the items in sections 2 and 3 eventually, and you'll get the items in section 4 throughout the game, so you don't have to steal them from wild pokemon. Only do so if you desperately want them now.

1. Consumables.
Berry Juice -- Appears on Shuckle (always). Shuckles only appear in Safari Zone Johto, but on the other hand, they always have Berry Juice on them. Better to buy them, probably.
Moomoo Milk -- Appears on Miltank (always). The only place to farm them is Route 39.
Sacred Ash -- Appears on Ho-Oh (always). If you want to farm them (why?), they are on Route 1.

2. Berries.
Aspear Berry -- Appears on Jynx and Smoochum (always). Best place to farm them is Ice Cave.
Rawst Berry -- Appears on Vulpix, Growlithe and Arcanine (always). Best place to farm them is Route 8.
Leppa Berry -- Appears on Clefairy and Clefable. Best place to farm them is Mt Moon 1F. Leppa Berry is common and you'll find lots of them while trying to get their rarer items.
Oran Berry -- Appears on Sentret and Furret, common item on Furret. Furrets are only in Safari Zone Johto, and pretty rare to boot, so you should probably farm Oran Berries (if you want) from Sentret on Route 33
Chilan Berry -- Appears on Rattata and Raticate. Best place to farm them is Route 16 and Route 17.
Coba Berry -- Appears on Sunkern. Best place to farm them is National Park.
Passho Berry -- Appears on Donphan. Donphan only appears at Silver Conference and it's rare to boot. I don't suggest farming them for Passho Berries.
Payapa Berry -- Appears on Mankey and Primeape. Best place to farm them is Route 7.
Persim Berry -- Appears on Girafarig and Kecleon. Best place to farm them is Route 34.
Shuca Berry -- Appears on Ponyta. Best place to farm them is Pokemon Mansion 3F.
Sitrus Berry -- Appears on Furret. They only appear in Safari Zone Johto, and they are pretty rare.

3. Evolution items.
Deep Sea Scale -- Appears on Chinchou. Best place to farm them is fishing on Route 44. Needed to evolve Clamperl (into Gorebyss).
Dragon Scale -- Appears on Horsea, Seadra, Dratini and Dragonair. Best place to farm them is fishing on Cinnabar Island, Mikan Island, Pummelo Island or Blue Rock Isle. Needed to evolve Seadra.
Electirizer -- Appears on Electabuzz and Elekid. Best place to farm them is Navel Rock, floors 1F and 2F. Needed to evolve Electabuzz.
King's Rock -- Appears on Poliwhirl. Best place to farm them is fishing on Valencia Island. Needed to evolve Poliwhirl (into Politoed) and Slowpoke (into Slowking)
Magmarizer -- Appears on Magmar and Magby. Best place to farm them is Pokemon Mansion B1F and Burned Tower (Burned Tower is MUCH more accessible, though). Needed to evolve Magmar.
Metal Coat -- Appears on Magnemite and Magneton. Best place to farm them is Gringey City Power Plant. Needed to evolve Onix and Scyther. Also boosts Steel-type moves.
Moon Stone -- Appears on Clefairy and Clefable. Best place to farm them is Mt Moon 1F.

4. Type-boosting items.
Hard Stone - Rock booster. Appears on Corsola. Best place to farm them is fishing on Yellow Rock Isle.

Sharp Beak -- Flying booster. Appears on Fearow and Doduo. Best place to farm them is Route 17.
Silver Powder -- Bug booster. Appears on Butterfree. Best place to farm them is Valencia Island.
Soft Sand -- Ground booster. Appears on Diglett and Dugtrio. Best place to farm them is Navel Rock.
TwistedSpoon -- Psychic booster. Appears on Abra and Kadabra. Best place to farm them is Navel Rock, floors B1F and 3F.

5. Miscellaneous hold items.
Grip Claw -- Appears on Sneasel. Best place to farm them is the Silver Conference, but that is closing down soon. Next best place is the Ice Cave.
Lucky Punch -- Appears on Chansey. Unfortunately, Chansey is only in Safari Zone Kanto, and rare to boot. Common item.
Quick Powder -- Appears on Ditto. Best place to farm them is Pokemon Mansion 1F. Common item.

Metal Powder -- Appears on Ditto. Best place to farm them is Pokemon Mansion 1F.
Quick Claw -- Appears on Sandshrew, Sandslash and Meowth. Best place to farm them is Route 8.
Shed Shell -- Appears on Venomoth. Venomoth appears at the National Park during the Bug Catching Contest, but bear in mind you can also get Shed Shell there as a consolation prize.
Smoke Ball -- Appears on Koffing and Weezing. Best place to farm them is Pokemon Mansion (all floors).
Stick -- Appears on Farfetch'd. Best place to farm them is Ilex Forest.
Thick Club -- Appears on Cubone. Best place to farm them is Navel Rock, floors 1F and 2F.

Warning: If you go further, Silver Conference will become permanently inaccessible. If you want to do something there, do it now!

Go to Professor Oak's Lab and talk to him. He'll suggest you go to the Hoenn league. Before you leave though, check in with his aide, who'll give you a Shiny Charm. This increases the chance of running into Shiny Pokemon.

Now that we're done here, let's go to Vermilion City. The leftmost ship in the docks will take you to Littleroot Town.


---------------------------------------
START OF GENERATION 3: THE HOENN REGION
---------------------------------------

----------------
LITTLEROOT TOWN:

Fishing: *Wingull

Go to Professor Birch's Lab. You'll be thrown into a battle against May. DEMOLISH HER.
ICONIC BATTLE:
Pokemon Coordinator May
Torchic LV 5

Grab the Poke Ball with the Gift Torchic. The teleport in Professor Birch's Lab will now connect you with similar teleports in Kanto, Orange Islands, and Johto for fast inter-regional travel.

The north exit was previously blocked, but once you talk to Birch, you can go up to Route 101.

----------
ROUTE 101:
----------
Wild Pokemon: *Poochyena, *Duskull, Marill, Wingull, Azurill, Azumarill. Level 3-5.

Azurill is available here if you haven't bred your own yet.

Short route. An old guy on the right will give you TM41 (Torment).

Continue north to Oldale Town.

------------
OLDALE TOWN:
------------
Nothing here apart from a person who will tell you about how trade evolutions work in Fire Ash. Unlike his other friends, he tells you about trade evolutions for Gen 3 pokemon (hopefully you’re starting to see the pattern here).

Continue west to Route 102.

----------
ROUTE 102:
----------
Wild Pokemon: Poochyena, *Zigzagoon, *Ralts, *Wurmple, *Lotad, *Seedot, *Surskit. Level 3-5.

Lots of new faces here.

Here you can also find the first instance of a "Berry Patch", which usually contain berries that are hard to come buy without buying them. In this berry patch, you can find 2 Oran Berries, 2 Pecha Berries and a whooping 80 Kelpsy Berries! Get used to these quantities!

Continue west to Petalburg City.

---------------
PETALBURG CITY:
---------------
Fishing: Magikarp and Goldeen.

Nothing here right now apart from a hidden Great Ball. It is hidden in the middle flower in the top row in the flower bed south of the Pokemon Center.
You can talk to May by the water if you want to, but she doesn't do much other than welcome you to her hometown.

As you prepare to head west out of town, you'll run into Norman, the Gym Leader. He won't let you battle him officially for a badge yet, but he will have a short match with you.
ICONIC BATTLE
Gym Leader Norman

PETALBURG WOODS:
----------------
Wild Pokemon: Wurmple, Taillow, Shroomish, *Cacnea, *Seviper, Ekans, Koffing, Sentret (rare), Pinsir (rare). Level 4-8.

There’s a Moss Rock here, meaning that this is the first place where you can obtain Leafeon. Simply level up an Eevee here.

You start near an item (an Antidote). Continue right along the way. When you reach the second grass patch, search an empty corner (empty tile in a 2x2 square of otherwise grass) for a Poke Ball. From there head left to find an ICONIC LV 5 Taillow. Go back the way you came and you'll find a trainer there on the northern path, but pass him by for now. 

Continue right and down. Jump the ledge and grab an item (another Antidote). When you exit the grass patch, go down and left to find an ICONIC LV 5 Treecko.

Continue up and fight a second trainer.
Bug Catcher James
Nincada LV 6 x2

Jump down the ledge and go left and up to get out of the woods. You'll have to beat the first trainer though. He's the pokemon poacher that Jessie and James sacrificed their Weezing and Arbok to stop.
MINOR ICONIC
Burglar Rico
Fearow LV 5
Tyranitar LV 6

After beating him, head out of the Petalburg woods into the northern part of Route 104.

Right outside the forest, there's a Berry Patch containing 2 Oran and Cheri Berries, as well as 3 Pecha Berries and 80 Grepa Berries.

Nosepass LV 14

Beat her for Stone Badge and TM69 (Rock Polish). The Hoenn Teleport System starts working. It works exactly like the teleport systems in Kanto and Johto.

But wait, there's more! Go to the Devon Corporation and talk to the guy in the upper right part of the lobby to obtain another Exp. Share -- those always come in handy. 

The Devon Corporation upstairs has a Team Aqua member (will be abbreviated TA from now on) trying to cause problems.
TA Ted
Crawdaunt LV 14

Just below the Devon Corporation is Mr. Briney's house. Now that you've beaten the Gym, he'll let you go to Dewford Town for you to get the next gym badge.

When you beat him, he'll tell you to fight him again on Route 106. The only way from the town is the Granite Cave, so go there.

-------------
GRANITE CAVE:
-------------
Wild Pokemon: Loudred, *Aron, *Makuhita, *Sableye, Abra, *Mawile, Geodude. Level 9-12.
Notice the Loudred. Whismur, its lowest evolutionary stage, CAN be obtained eventually, but it will take a long time - you might prefer to just breed a Loudred.

From the start, go right and down into a dead end with a Rare Candy hidden in a rock.

Then go left. You'll find Steven at the end of the path. He will give you a hint as to where the stairs to the upper portion of the cave is, as well as TM110 (Steel Wing).

Go up a bit to a cliff. Stand on the tile right to a pile of rocks and search the cliff. You'll find stairs.

Go right from the stairs all the way to the end to find an Everstone. Then go back left and down at the end to reach the exit to Route 106.

----------
ROUTE 109:
----------
Fishing: Wingull and Tentacool.

Once you go up, you'll immediately get into a battle with a trainer.
Sailor Huey
Wingull LV 12

Then go up and left - in the NW corner of SW step-like shore is a hidden Heart Scale.

Go up. Under the middle of the closest shelter is a Revive.

Go right and fight a second trainer.
Sailor Ed
Wingull LV 13

NE from the trainer, in a corner of a beach, is another hidden Heart Scale.

Cool Trainer Tommy
Swampert LV 16

That's all that can be done here; continue north to Slateport City.

---------------
SLATEPORT CITY:
---------------
On the left side is a MARKET. It has to be written in all caps, since it's a really great MARKET selling lots of strange and wonderful items.

There's 7 vendors here altogether.

So, there's finally a permanent Incense shop, but the most interesting shops are definitely Poke Ball shop and Evolution shop. This is a good time to mention what you need them for. Many evolutions in main series games work by trading, but you can find changes to how trade evolutions work in Fire Ash by talking to a specific person in the 2nd place of every region. Alternatively you can read the file in the Helpful Notes folder from where you load up your game on called “Pokemon Fire Ash Evolution Changes''.

During the DAY:
Deep Sea Scale: Evolves Clamperl into Gorebyss.
King's Rock: Evolves Poliwhirl into Politoed.
King's Rock: Evolves Slowpoke into Slowking.
Magmarizer: Evolves Magmar into Magmortar.
Metal Coat: Evolves Onix into Steelix.
Up-Grade: Evolves Porygon into Porygon2.
Prism Scale: Evolves Feebas into Milotic.
Protector: Evolves Rhydon into Rhyperior.
Sachet: Evolves Spritzee into Aromatisse
Whipped Dream: Evolves Swirlix into Slurpuff.
Oval Stone: Evolves Happiny into Chansey.

During the NIGHT:
Deep Sea Tooth: Evolves Clamperl into Huntail.
Dragon Scale: Evolves Seadra into Kingdra.
Dubious Disc: Evolves Porygon2 into Porygon-Z.
Electirizer: Evolves Electabuzz into Electivire.
Metal Coat: Evolves Scyther into Scizor.
Reaper Cloth: Evolves Dusclops into Dusknoir.
Razor Claw: Evolves Sneasel into Weavile.
Razor Fang: Evolves Gligar into Gliscor.

Either buy them in advance, or return here when you want to evolve one of these Pokemon. For extra information on how to evolve these pokemon, check out Pokemon Fire Ash Evolution Changes.txt.

Now for the Poke Balls. The important stat for a Poke Ball is its "catch rate", which states how much better it is than a standard Poke Ball. At this point, our basic type is Ultra Ball with a catch rate of 2.

Level Ball - The catch rate differs:
	If your Pokemon is at a higher level than the opponent, Level Ball is already as good as an Ultra Ball, with a catch rate of 2.
	If your Pokemon is at least 2 times higher than the opponent's level, it has a catch rate of 4
	If your Pokemon is at least 4 times higher than the opponent's level, it has a catch rate of 8.
Since you should have some highly levelled Pokemon, Level Balls should become your standard Poke Ball. It will always be at least as good as an Ultra Ball (unless you're trying to catch something that has a higher level than you), and is four times cheaper! Just remember that you should send a high-leveled Pokemon out before you use it.

Lure Ball: The catch rate is 4 while fishing, so unless your Pokemon is less than 2 times the level of the wild Pokemon, use a Level Ball instead.

Moon Ball: Has a catch rate of 4 if you use it on a Pokemon from a family that evolves with a Moon Stone, that is Nidoran (both genders), Clefairy, Jigglypuff, Skitty, Munna and their relatives. This is pretty niche, seeing that at this point you are probably only missing Skitty and Munna, and even for them, Level Ball might be as good or better.

Friend Ball: Has a catch rate of 1 (like a standard Poke Ball) but comes with an extra effect: The caught Pokemon's happiness becomes 200. Which saves some time, at most. Not a priority.

Love Ball: Has a catch rate of 8 if you use it on something of the same species and opposite gender as your Pokemon, which is not really something practical. Perhaps you could use it in conjunction with the Cute Charm ability (which improves a chance of meeting opposite-gender Pokemon) if you want to obtain a rare gender of some species.

Heavy Ball: Instead of having a flat catch rate, it gives additive bonuses based on the opponent's weight. Could be useful for some heavy Legendaries, as well as Rock and Steel Pokemon in general.

Fast Ball: Has a catch rate of 4 if you want to catch a very fast Pokemon (base Speed stat 100 or higher). You don't need Fast Balls for normal Pokemon, but some Legendaries have high Speed and Fast Balls might be a good choice for them. I'll let you know when you meet them.

Repeat Ball: Has a catch rate of 3.5 if the Pokemon is already registered in your Pokedex as caught. If you are just trying to fill the Pokedex, you won't find much use here.

Timer Ball - This is an interesting one: it improves its catch rate the longer the battle goes on. It starts with 1 and improves roughly by 0.30 per turn. On the 5th turn, it's already better than Ultra Ball. If you let the battle go for 11 turns, Timer Balls will reach a catch rate of 4 and it will be twice as good as Ultra Ball. Buy a lot of Timer Balls - they will be our main ammunition against Legendaries from now on. Just remember that if you have something with better than double the level of the Legendary, Level Ball will still be better.

Nest Ball: This one works better on low-leveled Pokemon. The problem is that it won't have any special effects on Pokemon of level 30 or higher, and against anything weaker, you should have something with high enough level to reach a catch rate of 4 with Level Ball (Nest Ball will always have worse catch rate than 4, unless you actually find a level 1 opponent). Don't bother with Nest Balls - Level Balls are superior AND cheaper!

Net Ball: This is basically a variant of Lure Ball. Catch rate is 3.5 on all Water types AND all Bug types. It's more versatile than Lure Ball, but more expensive.

Dive Ball: Has a catch rate 3.5 on Pokemon while underwater. Waste of money.

Luxury Ball: Alternative to Friend Ball; while Friend Ball improves the initial happiness of the Pokemon, Luxury Ball increases the rate it grows. All in all, neither seems too good, but Friend Ball gives you the benefits right away AND is cheaper so avoid Luxury Ball unless you want to give your Pokemon some bling.

Heal Ball: Has a catch rate of 1 and heals caught Pokemon. This is basically useless. The only use would be if you wanted to use the captured Pokemon right away without sending it to the PC, and let's be honest, how useful is THAT?

Quick Ball: Has a catch rate of 5 on the first turn of a battle. There's probably no harm in maintaining a supply of these. Throw one whenever you encounter a new Pokemon, and if it won't work (not even the high catch rate will help much if the Pokemon is not weakened at all), just switch to other balls.

Dusk Ball: Has a catch rate of 3 in a cave area, or at night.

Recommendations:
1. Grab some Quick Balls, but don't go overboard.
2. Buy lots of Level Balls and use them as your default Poke Balls from now on.
3. Buy lots of Timer Balls and use them to catch Legendary Pokemon. Buy Fast Balls for fast Legendary Pokemon and Heavy Balls for heavy Legendaries (those should help a ton).
4. Get some Lure Balls and Dusk Balls, MAYBE some Net Balls. You can use those when their conditions are met, but if your Pokemon has more than twice the level of target, Level Balls will STILL be better.
5. Ignore the rest, or use them as novelty.

Once we're done with the MARKET, head to the eastern side of the city. There are several Team Magma (will be abbreviated TMg, so that they are not confused with TMs) grunts guarding the Museum. Beat them.

After you beat Tabitha, head inside the museum, where they will tell you that, despite being beaten, TMg managed to steal a rock sample. There's nothing we can do about it right now, so let's head back outside.

Go up past the Poke Mart. A house on the left has another Name Rater. The way north is blocked by a guy who wants us to support his girlfriend in a Pokemon Contest, so go there (it's the house in the NW corner of the city). Before you enter, chat with the guy standing beside the Contest Hall and fight him.

After this, head into the Contest Hall. You'll end up in another battle with May.

After you beat her, she'll leave, letting you challenge the other trainer left in the hall, Drew.

There's also a Move Tutor for Magic Room here.

After you're done, head north to Route 110.

----------
ROUTE 110:
----------
Wild Pokemon: Oddish, Zigzagoon, *Plusle, Poochyena, Wingull, *Electrike, *Minun, *Gulpin. Level 12-14.
Fishing: Tentacool and Magikarp.

Note that this route has a magnetic field - Magneton and Nosepass will evolve if you level them up here.

In the first grass patch to the right of the main path, there'll be another trainer.
MINOR ICONIC
Youngster Marius
Spheal LV 14

This is an extremely long, but linear path.

First of all, go north until you come to a house. There's a guy in front of it who will give you a quiz. The correct answers are:
1. Muk
2. Yellow
3. Illumise

By completing the quiz, he'll give you a Good Rod!

---GOOD ROD UPDATE:---
OK, now that you have a Good Rod, you can catch lots of new Pokemon even in older areas, right...? Right...?

Well, not exactly. Most fishing areas you have encountered until now have Good Rod catching the same two Pokemon as the Old Rod, with the only difference being that Old Rod has 7:3 chance of Common vs. Uncommon catch while Good Rod has 8:2 (so if you want the uncommon type, Old Rod is actually better!). Only a handful of areas have something new.

Pallet Town: Good Rod allows you to catch Tangela, Goldeen, or Poliwag.
Route 25: Good Rod allows you to catch Dragonite.
Safari Zone Kanto: Good Rod allows you to catch Seadra, Dragonair, and Tentacruel.
Safari Zone Johto: Good Rod allows you to catch Quagsire, Lanturn, or *Mantine.
Blackthorn City: Good Rod allows you to catch Horsea and Poliwag instead of Magikarp and Poliwag.
Route 110 (where you are now): Good Rod allows you to catch *Wailmer and Tentacool.

And that's all - all other areas have nothing new compared to Old Rod. So grab a Mantine and a Wailmer. Remember that Mantine can be bred with Wave Incense to obtain Mantyke. In order to evolve Mantyke, you need to have a Remoraid in your party, so if you already evolved it into Octillery, you'll need to get another one.

---END OF GOOD ROD UPDATE---

Continuing along Route 110, you'll encounter many trainers.

After that, then another hidden item (a Great Ball). It's tricky to find: near the top of the grass patch is a 4x4 square that is nearly complete (missing the lower left corner and 3-square path from the lower right corner). The Great Ball is hidden on the second tile of this path.

The final part of the Route has two trainers and a flower patch with two visible items: a Heal Ball and a Rare Candy, as well as a Berry Patch containing 6 Leppa Berries and 9 Nanab Berries.

FALLABOR TOWN:

This town greets you with some Berry Patches. They contain 4 Pecha Berries, 5 Aspear and Lum Berries and 80 Rowap Berries. Nice patch - 6/10.

But wait, there's more!

In the centre of the town, there are (from the top left to the bottom right) 80 Pamtre, Ganlon, Roseli, Occa, Payapa, Yache, Salac, Coba and Shuca Berries. I daresay that this will be the best set of patches we'll find in the entire game, so I'll start ranking these. This one's an 11/10. Previous one's a 7/10.
 
The Contest Hall (the middle building in the upper row) has some flowers in front of it; the left patch hides a Nugget. Beside the hall is a trainer who wants to battle before the contest. The left house in the upper row has a Move Maniac. In the SE corner is a Move Tutor for Dragon Ascent. Dragon Ascent is Rayquaza’s signature move, and in Fire Ash, it doesn’t allow Rayquaza to mega evolve - you will eventually get a held item that will allow it to.

A simple linear path with nothing of interest, apart from the wild Pokemon. If you haven't bread Magcargo, this is your chance to get a Slugma. Also, note that you will receive a Gift Torkoal very soon (after the next gym), so there’s not much point in catching one now.

Unlike other towns, this one does not have an accessible Pokemon Centre or Poke Mart, as they are apparently both being boycotted. Instead there are people outside the entrance who will perform the same functions, although the one outside the Poke Mart only sells berries.

There are three houses in the southern part of town. The hiker in the middle house gives you an Elixir, and the hiker in the south-eastern house gives you an Ether.

When you exit the grass patch, go left. In the upper right corner of a small alcove in the trees is a Full Restore.

Continue east to Route 121.

Wild Pokemon: Slakoth, Chimecho, Gardevoir, Zigzagoon, Beedrill, Flaaffy, Volbeat, Swablu. Level 23-26.
Fishing (Old Rod): *Clamperl and *Luvdisc.
Fishing (Good Rod): Mantine, Huntail, and Wailmer.

Right at the start, you will find a healer and a Berry Patch containing 2 Chesto Berries, 5 Aspear Berries, 6 Persim and Rawst Berries and 80 Colbur and Chilan Berries. Decent patch, but not as good as the first patch from the previous route. 6/10 patch.

Go right, fight the first trainer.
Beauty Jessica
Kecleon LV 30
Seviper LV 30

NE from you are twin trainers and there is an Escape Rope hidden in a NE corner next to them.
Twins Maddie & Allie
Spinda LV 30

Channeler Tammy
Ralts LV 30
Duskull LV 30

Go up stairs to a small platform with another trainer.
Bug Catcher Cale
Dustox LV 29
Beautifly LV 29

There's a Carbos hidden two tiles right and one tile up from the default position of that trainer.

The guy up the stairs from here is not actually a trainer, so don't bother talking to him. Just go back down and continue along the path where you'll encounter another trainer.
Pokemon Breeder Vanessa

After that, the path turns north. At the fork, go left and fight a trainer.
Pokemon Breeder Myles
Wingull LV 25
Numel LV 25

After, get a Shiny Stone at the end of the path.

Return past the previous trainer. The fence to the north has a break in it at one point. Go north through the hole until you reach the flower, then search the flower west of you for a Zinc. To the left of that, there is a visible Soul Dew.

Go south and fight two trainers.
Cool Trainer Marcel
Manectric LV 31
Shiftry LV 31

Grab a Max Revive at the end of the path.

Lastly, there's another Berry Patch to end this route. This one contains 6 Nanab Berries, 80 Micle, Tanga, Haban and Bluk Berries! Great patch - 8/10.

Continue east to Lilycove City.

--------------
LILYCOVE CITY:
--------------
A guy south from the entrance will give you TM71 (Stone Edge).

A guy in the Pokemon Centre will give you a Focus Sash.

The Contest Hall has a Move Tutor for Magic Coat and a trainer to battle.
Lass Kelly
Grumpig LV 32

The rightmost house in the top row has a Stats Judge. Note that as of game version 3.2 his functions have been removed.

The house north of the beach has a Name Rater.

The beach has a lot of boulders on it; three of them contain Heart Scales: the very leftmost one, the second rightmost one, and the one almost directly SW from the second one. All three items are Heart Scales.

Alright, now that we found a store that sells all the evolution stones (except Ice Stone which isn't used until Gen 4 to get Glaceon), let's just have a quick run of which Pokemon need them so you'd know how many of each you should get.

Fire Stone: Vulpix -> Ninetales, Growlithe -> Arcanine, Eevee -> Flareon, Pansear -> Simisear
Thunder Stone: Pikachu -> Raichu, Eevee -> Jolteon, Eelektrik -> Eelektross

To the east is Lance, who needs your help to stop TMg and TA from unleashing Groudon and Kyogre respectively. As it was the last time you teamed up with Lance, you must choose which team you want to face, and Lance will face the other team.

If you choose TMg, you will face:
TMg Buck
Houndoom LV 32
Mightyena LV 32

TMg Mike
Houndoom LV 32
Golbat LV 32

TMg Darren

TA Barry
Crawdaunt LV 32
Walrein LV 32

ICONIC BATTLE
TA Shelly
Carvanha LV 33
Crawdaunt LV 34
Walrein LV 33

Although you can choose whichever route you want, battling with TA gives you the highest exp yield, thanks to all the Walrein they have.

Regardless of which team you choose, after you beat them, you will have to face Groudon, and then Kyogre. Both are LV 35. Both of them are pretty heavy so you'll get bonuses from using Heavy Balls, although Groudon weighs more than Kyogre so it will have a higher bonus. However, their base Speed is under 100 so Fast Balls won't work well here.

Note that Kyogre has Aqua Ring for healing and Groudon has Rest.

Once they're caught, Lance thanks you and leaves, letting you go back to the captain who will now take you to Mossdeep City.

--------------
MOSSDEEP CITY:
--------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Tentacool and Wingull.
Fishing (Good Rod): Wailmer and Sharpedo.

Go north on the beach. You'll encounter a Move Tutor for Dynamic Punch and find a Big Pearl at the end of the path.

Outside of the Pokemon Centre, there is a trainer to battle.

On the tile left from Steven Stone's mailbox is a hidden Star Piece. Inside the house, Steven will give you a LV 30 Beldum.

The left house on the plateau in the NE part of the island contains two vendors. The left one sells:

Chesto Berry - 20
Pecha Berry - 20

On the raised ground before reaching the Space Center, there is a hidden Iron in the top left corner.

A guy blocking the elevator door in the Space Center will give you a Sun Stone.

The gym in this city is full of teleporters, similar to Saffron City. This time, the rooms are not in any particular grid, so I'll just list them by letters:

The Hoenn teleport system also updates again, allowing you to teleport to Lilycove City and Mossdeep City.

The next town is Sootopolis and if you ask around, you'll learn about a Psychic who can teleport you there. He's in the SE part of the island. Talk to him and get teleported to...

----------------------
IZABE ISLAND (PURIKA):
----------------------
Wait, what?

Fishing (Old Rod): Psyduck and Surskit.

Continue south to another part of Izabe Island.

----------------------
IZABE ISLAND (RIYADO):
----------------------
In the left house, there's an old woman who will give you TM107 (Curse).

The right house has a trader who will trade your Magneton for his Togetic.

Go through the Gate House to the Izabe Desert.

-------------
IZABE DESERT:
-------------
Weather forecast: Sandstorm
Wild Pokemon: Trapinch, Claydol, Rhydon, Camerupt, Phanpy, Donphan, Vibrava, *Baltoy. Level 27-32.

There’s a permanent sandstorm here, so try to take something that's immune to it. There's 8 guys in the desert, all trainers except one in the middle.

There are also three items: a Hard Stone in the very south, a second Hard Stone roughly in the middle, and a Muscle Band in the very north.

Enter the Izabe Cave in the eastern part of the desert.

-----------
IZABE CAVE:

In addition, there are two items: Never-Melt Ice and Bright Powder. Apart from a few ice puzzles, nothing major.

Note: The only puzzle that might present some difficulties is how to pass the second ice field. Do it like this:
1. Get the Bright Powder -- that is the easy part since most ways through the field can get you in this area.
2. Go to the left edge of this area, second tile from the bottom.
3. Go left, down, and right to end up at the correct exit.

At the end, get out to a third town of Izabe Island.

----------------------
IZABE ISLAND (CEROSI):
----------------------
There is a move tutor outside the Pokemon Centre that will teach you Icy Wind.

Not much else to do here. Talk to the sailor in the NE corner to be offered a ride - you can go to Mossdeep, Izabe, or Sootopolis.

Talking to this sailor unlocks the ferry system around Izabe Island. The right ship in Mossdeep City can now take you to Izabe Front (start of the island) or Izabe Back (here), and the ship at the start of the island can now take you here as well as back to Mossdeep City. Similarly, the "Izabe" choice on this ride will take you to the start of the island.

But we're going to press on and go to Sootopolis City!

----------------
SOOTOPOLIS CITY:
----------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Tentacool and Wailmer.
Fishing (Good Rod): Surskit, Sharpedo, and Tentacruel.

Go north and enter the first house after the Poke Mart. The two guys here will give you an Ether and an Elixir.

Go across the bay, past the Gym. Grab a Protein at the end of the path.

Nothing else can be done here at the moment, so hit the Gym.

This Gym is fairly open. It has six trainers before you face Juan.

When you defeat him, you'll receive the Rain Badge and TM96 (Bubble Beam).

Go to the Pokemon Centre. You'll learn that May wants you to come to Pacifidlog Town.

Beating Juan also updated the Hoenn teleport system again. Also, if you go to Fallabor Town, you will find a LV 50 Jirachi next to the Contest Hall! Catch it!

Note that Jirachi has a base Speed of 100, meaning that Fast Ball has a bonus against it. However, don't use Heavy Balls -- despite Jirachi being a Steel type, it's actually very light.

Also note that you might need multiple attempts. You can't just throw Jirachi to 1 HP using False Swipe -- it has Double-Edge and can accidentally KO itself.

Take the ship from Sootopolis City to Pacifidlog Town (note that you must get the scene in the Pokemon Centre first).

----------------
PACIFIDLOG TOWN:
----------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Tentacool and Wailmer.
Fishing (Good Rod): Surskit, Sharpedo, and Tentacruel.

The Pokemon here are mainly EXP fodder. We haven't found Shelgon's line elsewhere in the wild yet, but there will be Bagons in the wild soon.

NE lump: A trainer you can beat.

You start with the Elimination round (leftmost exit).

Alright, so we've got to Top 8 (where we're stopping). When you go out, one of Professor Oak's assistants meets you and asks you to go see the Professor. The ship in Ever Grande Conference will now take you straight to Littleroot Town, so you can just teleport to Pallet Town and go visit him. He will tell you that the Battle Frontier has opened in Kanto. So, the third generation is not over yet - we still have to deal with this before we get to Sinnoh!

But before we start with Kanto Battle Frontier, some new Legendary Pokemon can now be obtained! But even before THAT, you can fight Tracey on the first floor of Oak's lab.
ICONIC BATTLE
Watcher Tracey
Venonat LV 50
Scyther LV 54
Marill LV 50

Now go to Route 121 (west of Lilycove City). Go west until you find the fishing platform (if you were catching Clamperl/Luvdisc here, you know where it is). Latias and Latios are now on this platform and you can fight them and catch them.

Both Latias and Latios are fast, so Fast Balls are preferable. They are troublesome because they both know Recover (so it's hard to keep them at low HP) and Psycho Shift (so they can pass status problems to your Pokemon instead).


--------------------------------------------
START OF GENERATION 3.5: THE BATTLE FRONTIER
--------------------------------------------

--------------
VIRIDIAN CITY:
--------------
Surprise! The Gym that got destroyed is now standing again! There are two important people here. One of them is Scott, the owner of the Battle Frontier. The other is Agatha, member of the Kanto Elite Four. Scott asks you to battle and beat Agatha, saying that if you succeed, he will invite you to take the Battle Frontier challenge.

You can now fight Agatha from the Elite Four who stands in front of it.
ICONIC BATTLE:

After you beat her, you will again talk to Scott, who congratulates you and gives you the Frontier Pass.

Then go west to Route 4. You might remember that there was an item here that you couldn't get before, but now part of the fence disappeared and you can grab a Life Orb.

Go a bit west from the fence. There is a path to the north. Take it to get to the Battle Factory.

---------------
BATTLE FACTORY:
---------------
Wild Pokemon: Growlithe, Beedrill, Graveler, Golem, Geodude, Arcanine, Onix, Jigglypuff, Cleffa, Clefairy. Level 35-38.

Liza, the Charizard girl is here again to act as a Day Care.

Enter the building.

Inside looks like a smaller version of the various Pokemon Leagues -- you have a Poke Mart and a Pokemon Centre in there, and a guy who lets you in to fight.

Note that despite what people here say, you don't get any rental Pokemon -- you fight Noland with your normal team.

Beating Greta gets you the Guts Symbol and unlocks two new places -- the southern exit from Lavender Town, and the eastern exit from Fuchsia City. They form a big loop -- let's go for it from the Lavender side.

There's a Move Tutor for Volt Tackle in the gate building. Go south to Route 12.

---------
ROUTE 12:

Afterwards, you can accept several eggs. If you want to take them, remember that the Breeding Center has a PC. It also has a healer inside.

So, there's a total of 9 eggs you can get (despite the claims that they will give you one as a gift, you can grab all nine). They are: Cleffa, Eevee, Igglybuff, Pichu, Magby, Makuhita, Smoochum, Vulpix, and Elekid. You probably don't NEED any of them (maybe except Eevee since you need a LOT of those to complete the Pokedex), but hey, they are free.

The SW corner of the island (before the pier) has a hidden Iron.

Three more trainers and then you can leave south to Route 13.

In the NW corner, next to a cliff, is a hidden Zinc (it's on the tile you have to go through in order to reach the grass patch). In the SW corner, there's 5 Pinap Berries hidden in a flower (second flower from the left in the top row).

In the SE corner of this Route is Celebi! Fight and catch it. Celebi's Speed Stat is 100, so Fast Balls work on it. Actually, it shouldn't be that hard -- Celebi has a much higher catch rate than most Legendaries.

Continue west to Route 15.

---------
ROUTE 15:
---------
Wild Pokemon: Kangaskhan, Linoone, Elekid, Dugtrio, Seedot, Scyther, Nuzleaf, Exeggutor, Volbeat, Illumise. Level 35-39.

Beating Anabel opens the last stage of Battle Frontier, but first there’s something else we can do here on Route 26. There's an island in the lake and Deoxys appears on the island! Deoxys is fast, so Fast Balls are the preferable ammunition.

Then go to Pewter City and take the new exit west to Battle Pyramid.

WHEW! That's a lot. Moving on now.

The house in SE corner has a guy who will give you TM84 (Poison Jab).

Once you defeat Dawn, you can go through the eastern exit and reach Route 205.

---------------------
ROUTE 205 (1st part):
---------------------
Wild Pokemon: *Combee, Shinx, Bellsprout, Budew, Swinub, Bellossom, Skiploom, Sandshrew, Growlithe, Bidoof. Level 8-13.
Fishing (Old Rod): Goldeen and Quagsire.
Fishing (Good Rod): Whiscash and Wooper.

When catching a Combee, make sure you get a female! Only female Combees can evolve. The best way to ensure it is to have a male Pokemon with Cute Charm ability leading the party. The possible Pokemon with this ability that you can have at the moment are Clefairy line, Jigglypuff line, Skitty line, and maybe Sylveon or Lopunny if you've evolved one. All those Pokemon can have another ability and/or be female, so look through your collection to see what you have.

Right at the start, there's a Berry Patch containing 10 Oran Berries. 2/10 patch. Let’s hope that future Sinnoh berry patches are better than this...

This is a big and fairly open route. You'll encounter 8 trainers as you make your way north.

There are four visible items -- south to north, they are: an X Attack, a Heal Ball, a Poke Ball, and a Repel.

From the Repel, go north as far as you can, then one tile left and check the tile above you for an X Defense.

The house in the northern part of the route has a healer.

To the southeast of the house, there are some metal poles. The tile below the 3rd one from the top has a hidden Stardust.

Since the path to the NE is blocked, go north into Eterna Forest.

--------------
ETERNA FOREST:
--------------
Wild Pokemon: Combee, *Burmy, Caterpie, Ledyba, Shroomish, Sunkern, Kakuna, Gloom, Vespiquen. Level 8-13.

Note Burmy. You might want more of those because it can evolve in several different ways: males evolve into Mothim (Bug/Flying), but females evolve into Wormadam whose type depends on the "cloak" your Burmy has -- fighting in grass will make it evolve into Bug/Grass, fighting in caves into Bug/Ground, and fighting in cities into Bug/Steel.

Eevee will evolve into Leafeon if you level it up here as there is a Mossy Rock here.

Once you enter the forest, you'll get into another battle with TR.

The path to the contest hall is blocked by three small trees that can’t be cut down. Search the middle one for a Berry Juice.

There's a PP Up next to the Bike Shop.

The tall house has a Name Rater on Floor 2, as well as a guy who will give you a Leppa Berry (it doesn't matter how you answer his question). On the top floor is a trader who will trade your Buizel for his Chatot.

The eastern part of a town contains a shop that sells:

The tile in front of the door hides a Max Revive. Inside is Dr. Footstep who will tell you about the happiness of your Pokemon.

Note that if he judges a Pokemon as "super friendly", it means that happiness is at max. Such Pokemon are eligible to get a Footprint Ribbon from him, and if it evolves by happiness, it will definitely evolve upon leveling up.

If he says that a Pokemon is "quite friendly", it MIGHT be able to evolve (if it evolves by happiness). It's not guaranteed, but even if it can't evolve yet, it only has a short way to go.

From the house, continue east. Turn north at the first boulder and search the next boulder you come to for another Heart Scale. Fight the trainer in the area.

Then talk to the second guy for a Water Stone, then go east towards Valor Lakefront and north along the rock face to a HP Up in the NE corner.

There's a Yellow Shard in this area and 2 Berry Patches: the western one has 3 Iapapa Berries and 3 Rawst Berries, and the eastern one has 3 Aguav Berries and 3 Rawst Berries (Is it just me, or does this feel a bit stingy after the all the previous patches?). Anyway, 4/10 patch.

With Dialga and Palkia caught, we can go to Celestic Town with them. When you talk to the people in the Historic Center, one will give you the Lustrous Orb for Palkia, and one will give you the Adamant Orb for Dialga (you have to put the specific Pokemon in your front slot). You can always do this later if you find it inconvenient to do this now.

----------------
SUNNYSHORE CITY:
----------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Krabby and Corphish.
Fishing (Good Rod): Octillery, Politoed, and Lanturn.

The green Poke Mart clone is a Stone Shop. It has two clerks. The upper one sells:
Fire Stone - 2100
Water Stone - 2100
Thunder Stone - 2100
Leaf Stone - 2100
Moon Stone - 2100

The bottom one sells:
Sun Stone - 2100
Shiny Stone - 2100
Dusk Stone - 2100
Dawn Stone - 2100
Ice Stone - 2100

This is the first place where you can get an Ice Stone, meaning that you can get a Glaceon by evolving Eevee with an Ice Stone if you want to.

Next to the stone shop, you can grab the Zap Plate.
!!! Plate Collection: 17/17 !!!

There's also a Thunder Stone, but you'll have to go around to get it -- and by that I mean that you'll have to go to the NE corner of the city and follow the narrow path along the eastern edge.

On the eastern side of town, there is a ship guarded by a trainer, who will give you the Power Belt and the Power Band.
MINOR ICONIC
Black Belt Buck
Baltoy LV 49

Once they leave, collect a Life Orb there. Unfortunately, the damage to the tower means that the Gym will be offline for a while. In the meantime, Nurse Joy at the Pokemon Centre tells you that someone's been asking for you to head towards the Valor Lakefront, so let's head there.

Outside the Contest Hall, You'll meet Bertha, who will challenge you to a battle.
ICONIC BATTLE
Elite Four Bertha

After she's beaten, you can now enter the contest hall and fight some trainers. This is the Sinnoh Grand Festival, so it's basically a who's who of Dawn's rivals, plus Dawn herself.

This will grant you the Beacon Badge and TM93 (Wild Charge).

Alright, so that's all Sinnoh gyms done, the Sinnoh teleport system is complete, and we can continue to the League -- but before that, there's a whole lot of smaller things to do.

1. Dawn appears in the eastern part of the town, on the path to the Sinnoh League ship. Fight her.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Coordinator Dawn
Piplup LV 47
Mamoswine LV 47

2. The guy with a Skarmory close to the tower will now offer to fly you to the three lakes (Lake Verity, Lake Valor, and Lake Acuity). You'll always end up on an island with the cave where you can find a Legendary Pokemon: Lake Verity has Mesprit, Lake Valor has Azelf, and Lake Acuity has Uxie. All of them are LV 50.
3. Go back to Route 222 and go to the beach. There's a sandbar you can get to, which now has Heatran and Shaymin, both LV 50.
4. Mt. Coronet opens -- go to Hearthome City and talk to the girl with Abra in the SW corner. You can find Giratina there at LV 50. This is also one of the places where you can evolve Magneton and Nosepass since there is a magnetic field. There are no random battles, so you'd have to level them up using a Rare Candy unless you want to get EXP by killing Giratina. (You don't.) Be sure to also grab the Griseous Orb in the corner.

As for recommended Pokeballs, you should use Fast Balls for Azelf and Shaymin and Heavy Balls for Heatran and Giratina. Mesprit and Uxie will probably be best dealt with with Timer Balls.

With everything done and eight new Legendary Pokemon, go to Sunnyshore City and take the ship to the Lily of the Valley Island.

--------------------------
LILY OF THE VALLEY ISLAND:
--------------------------
Wild Pokemon: Lunatone, Solrock, Claydol, Vileplume, Voltorb, Pineco, Onix, Golem, Mantine, Gloom. Level 35-38.

This island is formed from four smaller connected islands. You start at the SE island. The NE island has shops, and by now you should know what they are.

That's as far as you can get. As usual, once you leave the island, you're no longer allowed to come back.

Return back home to Pallet Town and talk to Professor Oak to start Gen 5!

But before we go to Unova, there are a few more Legendary Pokemon to get:
1. Go to Lake Verity (through Route 201, west from Sandgem Town) and fight Manaphy there. 
2. Go to Lake Valor and fight Arceus there. Put it in your party and give him various plates to register its different forms in the Pokedex.
3. Go to Snowpoint City and talk to Brandon by the Temple. He’ll give you Regigigas.

Manaphy should be caught with Fast Balls while Heavy Balls are good for Arceus.

Now head to Pallet town and talk to Oak to get a new Gen 5 outfit and a new destination: Unova. Head to Viridian City and take the blimp to -- Nuvema Town!

If you missed obtaining TM37 Sandstorm from Forrest (Brock's younger brother) in Brock's house in Pewter City, you can now obtain it from Brock's younger sister Yolanda (who looks like a lass).


-----------------------------------
START OF GENERATION 5: UNOVA REGION
-----------------------------------

------------
NUVEMA TOWN:
------------
Right after you arrive, there's a guy in the blimp waiting room who will give you TM01 (Hone Claws).

A guy in the town will give you another Exp. Share.

West from the lab is Zekrom (LV 25) just chilling and waiting to be caught. Zekrom is heavy, so Heavy Balls are recommended.

The Lab has a healing machine, a PC, a Day Care guy, and a teleporter that connects to the labs in other regions (and to your house).

Go out of town to meet Trip and fight him.

No new Pokemon here, the encounters are exactly the same as on Route 1.

Start by going west and grabbing a Poke Ball in the grass. Go east past a trainer.
Youngster Jimmy

Go back and continue east, up the stairs, to grab another Potion on the plateau. Back to the second trainer and continue north, past one more trainer, to Striaton City.

STRIATON CITY:
--------------

The Gym has no normal trainers, just three leaders (and a restaurant, for some reason). You must fight them in the given order: Chili (on the left) first, then Cress (on the right), and finally Cilan (in the middle).

Fishing (Old Rod): Basculin.
Fishing (Good Rod): Swanna and Alomomola.

First of all, Darmanitan (evolved form of Darumaka) has a special "Zen Mode'' alternate form. You'll receive a Zen Mode Darmanitan soon, and Darumaka and Darmanitan here will only have its normal ability. As for Scolipede, that's actually a third-stage evolution. Don't worry, you will be able to get its base form, Venipede, pretty soon.

First thing you'll find here is a preschool up the stairs to the north. Fight the two trainers here.

This is another location where Eevee can evolve into Leafeon.

From the start, go west. You'll meet a pair of double trainers.
Twins Mayo & May

After, you'll reach a big grass patch with a trainer.
Lass Millie
Pidove LV 16

--------------
CASTELIA CITY:
--------------
Now that's a lot of Venipedes. You can fight them, but there's no real point since they don't disappear after you defeat them. For now, only one house and the Pokemon Centre are accessible -- all other places are blocked by the Venipedes.

The Pokemon Centre has a guy who will give you a Zoom Lens. The house has another battle with TR.
ICONIC BATTLE
TR's Jessie & James
Woobat LV 18
Yamask LV 20

Once you beat them, the Venipedes will disappear and you will be able to access the rest of the city.

The sailor in the SE corner will give you an evolution stone based on how you answer his question:
Pansage - Leaf Stone
Pansear - Fire Stone
Panpour - Water Stone

You can only do this once, but at this point, you can buy as many of these as you want, so it doesn't really matter what you say.

A little girl on the central street will give you a Destiny Knot.

The guy in the NE corner of the city sells Casteliacones for 100 pokedollars. It's basically a Full Heal, except much cheaper in exchange for only being available at one place.

So that's for the outside of the city, but what's in the buildings?

Nice, but nothing new.

Heading back to the main road, you'll now reach a crossroad. The way north is blocked, so you'll have to go west. This path has three trainers.

It has a visible Hyper Potion, and a hidden Ether. It's hidden in the middle of the three boulders in this area.

Eventually, you'll get to a new area of Route 4 with new set of Pokemon:

Wild Pokemon: *Emolga, *Cubchoo, *Joltik, *Audino, Scrafty, Mandibuzz, *Larvesta, Simisear, Scolipede. Level 15-18.

Cubchoo is the base form of Beartic. Joltik is the base form of Galvantula you have probably met before. Scrafty is the evolved form of Scraggy, but you should already get one from the egg the Day Care lady gave you. Mandibuzz is the evolved form of Vullaby. It will take some time before you can catch a Vullaby, so if you want to breed a Mandibuzz, that's also an option.
Finally, Simisear is the evolved form of Pansear. You'll be able to catch a Pansear soon.

There is a Move Tutor for Role Play to the left of the house. Enter the house (Club Battle). You need to fight four trainers.

There are two visible items here (a Dusk Stone and a Protein), and one hidden item: a Nugget. It's in the 4x4 square patch of grass, 2nd tile from north and 2nd from east.

Once you're done here, return to Nimbasa City and leave through the west exit to Route 5.

Wild Pokemon: *Lillipup, Deino, Sawsbuck, *Boufallant, Axew, Pansage, Pansear, Panpour, *Gothita, Gigalith, Garbodor. Level 19-22.

There's also a vendor who sells berries out of a truck. Probably illegally harvested, I'd wager.

You can fish from the bridge, though the only Pokemon you can catch there with either rod is Ducklett.

The Pokemon Centre has a trader who will trade his Zorua for your Minccino.

On the way to the gym, you'll run into a Move Tutor for the move Drill Run.
Finally, talk to Clay in front of the Gym. He doesn't want to fight cuz the world might be ending on Milos Island -- bummer. Go to the southern part of the city and talk to the sailor. He wouldn't help you before but now he'll take you to Milos Island.

- and finally Landorus.

Once you fight Landorus, you'll be transported back to Driftveil City. You can still take the boat back, but the trainers will be gone now and the weather will calm down -- the only reason to come back is to fight wild Pokemon or fish.

Back in Driftveil City, fight Chili who now blocks the way to the Gym. Go inside.

Note that in order to evolve Shelmet and Karrablast, you must level them up when you have both in your party. Both can evolve in the presence of either the base OR the evolved form of the other, so you can't miss on it.

Start by going west past a bridge. Fight a trainer in the first grass patch.

At this point, you can talk to the sailor and go to Virbank City. But before we do that, let's continue east to Route 9.

--------
ROUTE 9:
--------
Wild Pokemon: Ferroseed, Tynamo, Gothita, Cottonee, Whimsicott, Zebstrika, Krokorok. Level 30-33.

Another fairly open road divided into a safe northern part and a grassy southern part.
There's 7 trainers in total, all in the northern part (two guard the entrance to the southern part).

Each part also has one visible and one hidden item.

In the northern part, the visible item is a Full Restore. To get the hidden item, some searching is needed. Find an L-shaped group of bushes in the western part of the Route. Stand east from the easternmost tree there, walk three tiles south and check the tile to the east for a Lemonade.

The visible item in the southern part (way west from where you enter this part) is a HP Up. To find the hidden item (a Max Ether), go to the middle of the three big grass patches there. Its northern edge has three connected grass tiles and one single one. Go to the middle of the three and search the tile south of you.

The path to the east is impassable for now, but you can enter the big building which is a... Shopping Mall? Sure, why not.

We've seen enough of these by now, so just quick notes: 2F has some basic Poke Mart items (healing/Poke Balls) 3F has a Move Tutor (Last Resort). 4F sells evolution stones (all except for Ice Stone) and 5F sells Vitamins and X- items. There's also a guy on 5F who will give you a Thunder Stone.

East of this is a green Poke Mart clone that sells you Gems. It has two clerks. The upper one sells:
Rock Gem - 200
Water Gem - 200
Electric Gem - 200
Grass Gem - 200
Poison Gem - 200
Psychic Gem - 200
Fire Gem - 200
Ground Gem - 200

The bottom one sells:

Ghost Gem - 200
Fighting Gem - 200
Steel Gem - 200
Ice Gem - 200
Dragon Gem - 200

That's all for now. Return to the sailor on Route 8 and sail to Virbank City.

-------------
VIRBANK CITY:
-------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Frillish.
Fishing (Good Rod): Jellicent, Swanna, and Alomomola.

House next to a Gym has a guy who will trade your Koffing for his Gurdurr.

Go north. Next to the Pokemon Centre is a group of vases. The one in the center has a Full Heal in it.

And there's also Meloetta. Talk to it and it will come with you.

With Meloetta in tow, you can enter the Gym. There is a Rare Candy hidden in the jug next to the gym. The Gym itself has just two trainers and Roxie.

Beat Roxie for the Toxic Badge and TM34 (Sludge Wave).

When you leave the Gym, you'll meet Cynthia who invites you to Undella Town. Unova teleport system gets updated. Which is a good thing since we have just gotten our 8th Unova Badge and that means we have unlocked some more stuff!

At this point, you can go and catch the 3 Musketeers - Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion.

Cobalion (LV 50): Go to Driftveil City and leave to the west to Route 6. Go past the first three bridges (sigh...) and then north and east past yet another bridge to a cave. Cobalion will be there.

Terrakion (LV 50): Go to Icirrus City and enter Twist Mountain again. Pass through the first passage and you'll be in the central area again. Go south, and then west, to the cave that was blocked by rocks. You'll end up in Twist Mountain 4F; this area has a Glacial Rock so you can evolve Eevee into Glaceon there. It has normal random encounters and Terrakion is here.

Virizion (LV 50): Go to Nacrene City and leave to the west to the Pinwheel Forest. Continue to the second area and go north along the road. Turn east. Grab a Big Root in the grass patch and continue east and north into the trees. You'll get to a glade where Virizion is.

Cobalion and Terrakion are heavy so Heavy Balls are preferable. Virizion is not heavy enough, but it's fast, so use Fast Balls for it.

When you're done, go to Nimbasa City. You can now leave through the NE exit.

---------
ROUTE 16:
---------
Wild Pokemon: Rattata, Foongus, Pidove, Onix, Magnemite, Blitzle, Gothita, Hydreigon. Level 31-35.

This is a short Route which is, once again, divided into the "road" part (south) with trainers and a grassy part (north).

The southern part has three trainers and one item (a HP Up).

After you go through this Route, you'll exit to Undella Town.

-------------
UNDELLA TOWN:
-------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Staryu and Krabby.
Fishing (Good Rod): Wailord, Beartic, and Dragonite.

There are three houses in the northern part of the town. The middle house has Leftovers while the right house has a guy who will trade his Munchlax for your Cinccino. It's a chance to get Munchlax/Snorlax if you didn't catch the one on Orange Islands.

The Girl by the Pokemon Centre is a Move Tutor for Relic Song. Inside, there will be a guy who will give you a Prism Scale.

Go to the NW corner of the town. Before entering Cynthia's Villa, stand east to the sign and go one tile east, two tiles north and check the bush east of you for a Big Nugget. Next, go to the bottom left corner of the courtyard and pick up the Reveal Glass. Now enter the villa -- this will update the Unova teleport system so that now you can teleport here. Go north, west, and north into a room where you can fight Dawn.

(At this point, the blocked eastern exit on Route 9 will open as well. However, both Route 9 and Route 12 lead to the same place: Opelucid City.)

---------
ROUTE 12:
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Rufflet, *Vullaby, Amoonguss, Karrablast, Corphish, Buizel, Zweilous, Fraxure, Axew. Level 33-36.

-------------
VETRESS CITY:
-------------
Wild Pokemon: Stoutland, Swoobat, Eevee, Trubbish, Mareep, Zebstrika, Blitzle, Cryogonal, Garbodor, Bouffalant. Level 35-39.

There are three shops in the area: Incenses, Drinks, and Berries. I wonder where Team Rocket’s shop is...

You've seen several Leagues by now, so you know how they work. Register, then start with the far left exit and move to the right after every win. You'll have to fight in five battles.

ICONIC BATTLE
Gym Leader Cilan
Pansage LV 45
Stunfisk LV 42
Crustle LV 46

When you win, he will give you the Super Rod!

So, what's Super Rod for? In the locations you've seen so far, it won't actually help you all that much; usually, you'll be able to catch the same Pokemon you can get with Old Rod or Good Rod, except that they will be 10 levels higher.

Generally, if you're trying to catch a particular Pokemon, the Super Rod will improve your chances ONLY if you want to catch the "rarer" Pokemon with Old Rod. The most important example is probably Route 121 in Hoenn where Super Rod gives you a better chance to get a Luvdisc for potential Heart Scale farming.
In all other situations, however, a specific Pokemon is easier to catch with one of the other Rods.

The only exception from this general rule is Pallet Town, where you can get Horsea and Staryu with Super Rod, but none of the others.

Go to Nuvema Town and talk to Professor Juniper to start the N arc. Note that Vetress City will permanently close once you do that so if you want to do any shopping/leveling there, do it now.

After talking to Professor Juniper, go to Virbank City and take the newly opened western exit to Route 20.

---------
ROUTE 20:
---------
Wild Pokemon: *Maractus, *Pawniard, Minccino, Sunflora, Shinx, Amoonguss. Level 36-40.

Fishing (Super Rod): Ducklett, Alomomola, Beartic, and Swanna.

From the start, go west and north. You can fight and catch Genesect here at LV 50. Despite Genesect being a steel type, it's not all that heavy, so Heavy Balls won't work. However, it is also a bug type, so Net Balls are recommended.

Then go back and continue west along the Route. There are three trainers and one item (an Expert Belt) on the way, all quite easy to see.

South of the Pokemon Centre, behind some houses, is a Move Tutor for Secret Sword.

Nothing much here -- go to the Gym and fight Cheren.

Beating Colress will update the Unova Teleport system for the last time, and then you can fight Reshiram and capture it at LV 55. Reshiram is heavy, so use Heavy Balls.

After you exit the ruins, you'll be greeted by Alexa (no, not the AI), who will tell you about a new region that you should check out called Kalos. That's sound advice, but we still have some last minute things to do in Unova first; namely, catching Victini.

Head to Castelia City and exit north to Route 4. Go into the desert and make your way to the NE corner of this area. Victini will be there, our last Gen 5 Legendary at LV 50! Fast Balls are recommended.

And that's it for Unova! Go talk to Oak and then it's back to Viridian City. Take the blimp to its new destination, Lumiose City!


---------------------------------------
START OF GENERATION 6: THE KALOS REGION
---------------------------------------

-------------
LUMIOSE CITY:
-------------
While previous generations started us in a small backwater town, Kalos starts with a bang. Lumiose City is the big city place analogical to Celadon or Goldenrod, and, of course, it has a lot of places to visit, even though you are limited (for now) to its southern half.

It's also very round.

Let's start in the SW part. There's the lab of Professor Sycamore. It has the region teleport so you can quickly go anywhere else.

The house NW from the Lab contains TM92 (Trick Room).

Directly east from this house, across the street, is a store. It has an Incense shop and a Vitamin shop.

Go to the Gym (it's the tall building in the middle of the city that looks nothing like Gyms in the other regions). Talk to Clemont and Bonnie in front of the Gym and fight him.
ICONIC BATTLE
Gym Leader Clemont
Bunnelby LV 5

Then go west and pass behind the tall house to a ICONIC LV 5 Froakie. It may not look like it, but this one is special - it will have the ability Battle Bond when it evolves.

Go there and talk to Professor Sycamore to get a Mega Ring. We're now capable of performing Mega Evolution! If we can get the relevant items, that is.

There will be a Poke Ball on the table that contains the second Kalos starter, Fennekin. Grab it.

The southern exit from the city was blocked by a fight, but after you obtain Mega Ring AND talk to Clemont, it will clear. Go south. You end up in a gate building (how long has it been since we've actually been one of these?). Continue south to Route 4.

--------
ROUTE 4:
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Fletchling, *Bunnelby, *Inkay, *Dedenne, Rhyhorn, Venipede, Pidgey, Oddish, Volbeat, Illumise. Level 3-5.

In the official games, you need to hold your DS upside down in order to evolve Inkay. Here, you don't have to worry about it -- just raise it to level 30 and it will evolve.

The north part of the Route has two trainers.

That's all here, continue south to Santalune City.

---------------
SANTALUNE CITY:
---------------
There is a small plateau with an inaccessible house on the western side. Check the second tile from the right under the house for a Super Potion.

The house in the NE corner is a school. Talk to the rightmost child to get an X Defense.

The house in the SW corner has a guy who will trade his Farfetch'd for your Bunnelby. There is a hidden X Attack in the top right corner of the flower patch next to that row of houses.

--------
Wild Pokemon: Fletchling, Marill, Hoppip, *Whismur, Smeargle, Skitty. Level 10-12.

Yep, after the two locations with Loudred way back, we finally have a spot for Whismur, if you waited for it...

This Route has a bit of an unusual layout: it has a central path and two side areas, on the eastern and western side. But the side areas can't be accessed from the Route itself.

Start by going north along the main path, fighting two trainers along the way.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Evolving the Goomy line has changed in more recent Fire Ash versions. Goomy evolves into Sliggoo at LV 32, and Sliggoo evolves into Goodra by leveling up knowing Rain Dance, so don't toss that move aside as useless (yet. lol).

First of all, go to the Lumiose store (the building west of Pokemon Centre) and go to the top floor. There will be three guys who will gift you Hoopa, Diancie, and Volcanion, each at LV 50. In the middle of the room, there is a Diancite.
Next, teleport to Couriway Town and go south to Route 19. Enter the Terminus Cave and go to the back of the cave (where you fought TR once). You can now fight and capture Zygarde there at LV 60. Heavy Balls are recommended.

Now it's time to properly start the Alola arc! Return to Pallet Town and talk to Delia (Ash's mom), then head to Viridian City to get the blimp to Alola.


---------------------------------------
START OF GENERATION 7: THE ALOLA REGION
---------------------------------------

****************************
* DAY 1 -- STARTING SCHOOL *
****************************
--------
ROUTE 1:
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Grubbin, *Pikipek, Alolan Exeggutor, Spearow, Corsola, *Sandygast, Bonsly, Sudowoodo, Bewear. Level 2-5.
Fishing (Old Rod): *Pyukumuku and Slowpoke.
Fishing (Good Rod): *Bruxish, *Wishiwashi, and *Dewpider.
Fishing (Super Rod): *Pyukumuku, Slowpoke, *Bruxish, *Wishiwashi, and *Dewpider.

There will be eventually a chance to catch a Stufful (evolves into Bewear).

Grubbin evolves into Charjabug at level 20. To obtain its third stage, Vikavolt, you need to level it in a special magnetic field or by using a Thunder Stone on it like in SwSh (which is far easier). Currently, you have access to five magnetic fields: Route 110 in Hoenn, Route 207 and Mt. Coronet in Sinnoh, Chargestone Cave in Unova and Route 13 in Kalos.

Wishiwashi's ability only works if it is level 20 or above.

Go out of the blimp station and talk to your mom to get her out of your way (unfortunately, this technique usually doesn't work in real life).

There is a row of houses north of you. Sadly, only one of them can be entered and even there, there's nothing in interest.

You can now go either south or north. South is grass and a beach where you can fish. A fisherman on the beach will give you a Poke Ball and there's an Awakening in the grass. However, the Lab is blocked by a Litten so you can't get in. So you have to enter the big building in the north part: the Pokemon School. 

However, before you can enter, you'll have your first encounter with Alola's “evil” team. Team Skull (they will be abbreviated TS from now on). They really don’t do much compared to teams like Team Galactic or Team Flare.
ICONIC BATTLE
TS Tupp, Rapp, & Zipp
Salandit LV 3
Yungoos LV 3
Zubat LV 3

After they leave, you can enter the school. And it actually IS a big building.

Start by going straight north. You'll end up in a classroom which is the center of the whole school. Leave through the NE exit to reach Samson's office. Talk to him and give him the Egg.

For future reference, the western exit from the classroom takes you to a room with a healing machine and there's a PC right at the entrance.

Samson offers to let you join the school... provided you get parental permission. Go out and south to the beach. Grab the Poke Ball from the fisherman if you haven't done so yet. Your mom will be by the sea south of the lab. Talk to her to enroll in the Pokemon School.

The Lab will now be open. Go in to meet Kukui, and he'll show you around, including meeting a cute little Rockruff that's currently staying there. His house also contains a regional teleport. He'll give you a Rotom Pokedex.

Note that while the Rotom Dex follows you, you will not be able to use Fly (everywhere) or your Bike (outside of Cycling Road).

Now, the Alolan part of the game works a bit differently than the others. You will be a part of a class and instead of moving freely around the region, you'll be going on... missions, I guess. Or school trips. The characters living on Route 1 (Kukui, Samson, and your classmates) have dialogues that frequently change. There are two main ways to advance the story: going to school and sleeping in your bed (that also heals your party).

So let's head towards the school. Outside the main doors, you'll have your first meeting with Tapu Koko, who will give you a Z-Ring. This can be used to activate superpowered Z-Moves.

Now enter the school, and sit on your seat (the middle one in the top row). You'll get your first mission: explore the Melemele forest to the east.

Note that if you ever forget what to do, come back and look at the board behind Kukui. It will give you your current objective.

----------------
MELEMELE FOREST:
----------------
Wild Pokemon: Pikipek, Grubbin, *Mimikyu, Trumbeak, *Bounsweet, *Morelull, Shiinotic, *Oranguru, *Drampa, Alolan Exeggutor, Toucannon, Bewear. Level 2-5.

Continue east. The rest of the forest is one long winding path. Fight a trainer along this path and continue.
Youngster Kevin
Grubbin LV 5

In the NE corner you'll find Kukui. Talk to him to finish the mission. Grab a Full Heal south from Kukui and return to class.

Return to class. The next part is a battle. You need to battle one of your classmates. Let's meet them, since you'll see those characters a lot from now on:

Sophocles: SW seat, has bushy orange hair.

Kiawe: NE seat, has brown hair.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Kiawe
Charizard LV 6
Turtonator LV 7

For this assignment, you can fight any of them except Lillie (who, as she says, is not actually a trainer). You can only fight one of them but you probably don't really need the EXP from all of them at this point, do you?

After battling, Kukui will explain to you about Z Moves and Z-Crystals and tell you that completing Island challenges is a good way to collect them.

That's all for now. Let's head to Bed (at Kukui's lab).

*********************************
* DAY 2 - HAU'OLI CITY AND LANA *
*********************************
When you wake up, Kukui has a new mission for you: Go to Hau'oli City and meet with Lana. Hau'oli City is west of Route 1; the exit is now open.

-------------
HAU'OLI CITY:
-------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Poliwag and Slowpoke.
Fishing (Good Rod): Corsola, Sharpedo, and Pelipper.
Fishing (Super Rod): Poliwag, Slowpoke, Corsola, Sharpedo, and Pelipper.

The first house you come to is blocked off. The second house is where Sophocles lives. Nothing to do here now, but remember it for future reference.

South from there (down the stairs) is a beach. Find two hidden items:

1) Stand on the right tile of the right set of stairs. Go four steps south and check the tile to your east for a Fresh Water.

2) In the SE corner of the beach is a line of four tiles with sea on both west and east. Search the second one from the left for a Pearl.

After that, talk to the two guys on the beach. One gives you a Potion, the other is a Move Tutor for Giga Drain.

So, go back up stairs and west along the path. Next you'll see the Hau'oli Shopping Mall, but it's not accessible yet, as Litten is guarding it.

Next is a big house. Here is where Lillie lives. There's nothing here right now, but again -- keep it in mind for future reference.

West of the signpost, there is an old lady who’ll give you a Cheri Berry, Leppa Berry and Sitrus Berry.

Further west, the path splits. Go south and you'll see Aina's Kitchen. Once again, we'll come back here later.

Go south along the path, then east. Next house belongs to Mallow, but she's not in. Next building is the Pokemon Centre -- our first one in Alola, in fact.

East from the Pokemon Centre is a park -- grab a Poke Ball that is in there.

Then the path leads further south onto a pier. Lana's house is here, and she's outside. Talk to her to go to the Hau'oli Outskirts.

------------------
HAU'OLI OUTSKIRTS:
------------------
Wild Pokemon: *Salandit, Roggenrola, Charjabug, Cubone, Emolga, Rufflet, Spinarak, Zubat, Pikipek, Bewear. Level 5-8.
Fishing (Old Rod): Psyduck and Slowpoke.
Fishing (Good Rod): Corsola, Sharpedo, and Pelipper.
Fishing (Super Rod): Psyduck, Slowpoke, Corsola, Sharpedo, and Pelipper.

If you want to catch Salandit, catch a female one -- those are the only ones that can evolve (although you could breed till you got a female).

Hau'oli Outskirts is a really big place. It's not too annoying since you can mostly just avoid the tall grass.

From the start, go NE and enter the gap between the trees. Navigate the path to NE. Eventually you'll be able to go west through another gap. Fight a trainer.
Pokemon Breeder Ikue
Pichu LV 7
Pikachu LV 7

NW from her is a Super Potion and a bit west from that is a Great Ball.

Return to the trainer and go SW. There will be another trainer.
Gentleman Jeremy
Alolan Diglett LV 9

Then go west and north to a third trainer.
Lass Malia 
Happiny LV 9

Go north to an area that is walled off by the trees. There's another trainer here.
Gentleman Stanley
Makuhita LV 9

The NE corner of the area has a Full Heal.

Exit the area and go west and north, hugging the trees. When you get to the northern shore, continue east, then south.

You will see another gap to the south, but first go east and grab a Big Mushroom from the NE part of the island.

Now enter the gap. There is a trainer, and then a healer.
Gentleman Braiden
Umbreon LV 8
Pikipek LV 8

Continue south to the center of the island. In the NW corner is a Gift Popplio, grab it. Then check the boulder in the lake to fight a Gyarados LV 12.

After you beat the Gyarados, retrace your steps back to Lana. Talk to her -- she will heal you, but then you'll have to fight her.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Lana
Lapras LV 10
Popplio LV 10

After you beat her, you can go back to Hau'oli City. If you need to come back to Hau'oli Outskirts for any reason, the Lapras in Hau'oli City will now take you there and back.

Another day is done, go to bed.

********************************************
* DAY 3 -- THE MALL, SOPHOCLES, AND HOBBES *
********************************************
The next day you will be told to meet Sophocles in the mall. Go to the Shopping Mall in Hau'oli City, which is now open. Surprise! Another TR battle.
ICONIC BATTLE
TR's Jessie & James
Mimikyu LV 13
Wobbuffet LV 49

After the battle, you can shop with various vendors, who offer some basic PokeMart wares, as well as evolution stones, vitamins, and X-items. Nothing you haven't seen before.

Talk to Sophocles in the back and you will go to Hau'oli Tunnel. Immediately check the tile south of you; it contains a hidden Revive. Go north and beat three trainers.
Super Nerd Gerald
Morelull LV 12

Super Nerd Donald
Brionne LV 11
Alolan Meowth LV 11

Super Nerd Issac
Riolu LV 12

Grab another Revive and face a fourth trainer.
Super Nerd Henry
Grubbin LV 11
Trumbeak LV 11

Finally meet back with Sophocles himself who took time from his day job of writing Greek tragedies to heal you and fight you.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Sophocles
Togedemaru LV 13

Talk to him afterwards to get out of the tunnel; you cannot get back once you leave, but since you can miss at most 2 Revives here, it's not a big deal.

For the next part, go to school. You'll see Lillie take a Pokemon egg. Go to her home (the big mansion in Hau'oli City). Talk to the guy there (Hobbes) and fight him.
MINOR ICONIC
Gentleman Hobbes
Oricorio LV 14

Then go to Kukui's house and sleep.

******************************
* DAY 4 -- IKI TOWN AND HALA *
******************************
When you wake up, Kukui tells you that the bridge in the north of Route 1 is now open. Go west and north from the school to find it.

After passing the bridge, go east and grab the Eviolite. Then go into the trees to reach Route 3.

--------
ROUTE 3:
--------
Wild Pokemon: *Alolan Diglett, *Alolan Rattata, *Cutiefly, *Mudbray, *Alolan Meowth, Ribombee, *Passimian, Alolan Raticate. Level 10-14.

There is a TM129 (Brutal Swing) in the NE corner of the plains where you start.

The western exit is inaccessible right now. Go north and up the stairs instead. Fight the trainer at the top.
MINOR ICONIC
Gentleman Laki
Smeargle LV 15

Go east from there, then north for a trainer battle and a Heal Ball.
Picnicker Tatiana
Petilil LV 15

Go back south, then west and north along the main path and fight another trainer.
Camper Joshua
Growlithe LV 15

The path splits here. Go north and west. There's a corner below a plateau that hides a Stardust. Then you'll meet a guy who will give you a Soothe Bell, with a visible Sharp Beak next to him. Continue west for another trainer.
Camper Ian
Psyduck LV 15

Go south and then head back north up the stairs to find the final trainer along with two items: A Red Card and a Nest Ball.
Hiker Makana
Rockruff LV 14
Slowpoke LV 14

Continue west to Iki Town.

---------
IKI TOWN:
---------
Go down the stairs and into the town proper. To your west are two houses, but there is nothing interesting there. The guy standing by the east house is a Move Tutor -- he teaches Drain Punch.

Continue north and up the stairs. Talk to the woman for a Stardust.

Enter the house here and talk to Hala. He will send you to Route 2.

Talking to Hala unlocks the Alola teleport system. Teleport to Hau'oli City and leave through the NW exit to Route 2.

--------
ROUTE 2:
--------
Wild Pokemon: Alolan Rattata, *Wimpod, Pichu, Butterfree, Charjabug, Tauros, Miltank, Murkrow, Paras, Stoutland. Level 9-12.
Fishing (Old Rod): *Mareanie and Corsola.
Fishing (Good Rod): Chinchou, *Dhelmise, and Bruxish.
Fishing (Super Rod): *Mareanie, Corsola, Chinchou, *Dhelmise, and Bruxish.

Technically, we could have come here before, but apart from getting some Pokemon a bit earlier there wasn’t much of a point.

From the start, go north towards the stairs. In the corner to the right, there is a hidden Repel. Then, continue north and fight a trainer.
Pokemon Ranger Kaleb
Spearow LV 16

After that, Route 2 becomes much more open.

Go north along the path and turn east into the corridor between two rows of trees. There's a Super Potion in the grass here. Continue east. There will be a small nook to the north; search the NW tile of this nook to find a Star Piece. Continue east and grab the visible item, TM125 (Power Gem) and fight another trainer.
Beauty Ashley
Cottonee LV 16

You'll come to a cave entrance; this is Verdant Cavern and our next destination (if you come here without talking to Hala in Iki Town, the path will be blocked). But let's clear the rest of this Route before going in.

Go north and east around the cliff. Grab a Stardust there. Go north and west and fight a trainer.
Pokemon Ranger Jay
Butterfree LV 16

West from here is a big grass patch with a Nest Ball and another trainer inside.
Lass Isabella
Spearow LV 15
Cutiefly LV 15

Continue west and north. In the very NW corner of the Route is the last trainer, guarding another Nest Ball.
Beauty Krystal
Gastly LV 15
Misdreavus LV 15

That's all that is here; go back to the cave and enter.

---------------
VERDANT CAVERN:
---------------
Wild Pokemon: *Yungoos, Alolan Rattata, Gumshoos, Alolan Raticate. Level 12-16.

Go to the end of the cave and fight the Totem Gumshoos.
ICONIC BATTLE
Totem Gumshoos (2v3)
Gumshoos LV 19
Yungoos LV 14
Gumshoos LV 14

After beating Gumshoos, talk to it to get Normalium-Z for winning. Note that you HAVE to talk to it in order to unlock the next part of the quest. Go back outside. Kukui will be waiting for you. He'll tell you about the Z-Crystals, which allow one superpowered move per battle, the move type is dependent on the crystal that the pokemon has equipped.

Return to Iki Town.

Hala will now be in the northern part of the town. Fight him.
ICONIC BATTLE
ISLAND KAHUNA HALA (2v2)
Crabrawler LV 19
Hariyama LV 21

After you win, he's about to give you a Fightinium-Z, when Tapu Koko shows up to give you an Electrium-Z.

Go to Kukui's House and talk to the ICONIC LV 18 Rockruff there. It will join you.
This Rockruff is special and will evolve into a Dusk Form Lycanroc (like Ash’s in the anime) when it reaches level 25 or above during 5pm and 8pm, which is more lenient than the main series games.

As an aside, the best Day Care right now is in Sinnoh. That's because it has the best path: Sinnoh stop of the inter-regional teleport is in a town with Pokemon Centre, and therefore a regional teleport that can get you right to Solaceon Town where the Day Care is. Kalos has the same feature, but the Day Care is a bit farther from a Pokemon Centre.

But you might want to wait a bit -- the next Day Care has even better placement.

Go to bed -- another day done!

********************************************
* DAY 5 - LILLIE, KIAWE, AND PANIOLA RANCH *
********************************************
The next day, Kukui tells you to go to Lillie's house in Hau'oli City. Do so. You can now fight Lillie.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Lillie
Alolan Vulpix LV 19 (Snowy)

Afterwards, go back to Route 1. East of the school is Kiawe with a Charizard. Talk to the Charizard and go to Akala Island.

-------------
PANIOLA TOWN:
-------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Wishiwashi and Alomomola.
Fishing (Good Rod): Pelipper and Gyarados.
Fishing (Super Rod): Pelipper, Gyarados, Wishiwashi, and Alomomola.

First of all, there are two flowers to the SW. The one further from you hosts a hidden Revive.

North of you are two houses. The eastern one has a guy who will give you a Quick Ball.

A guy south of the houses will give you a Moomoo Milk.

The SW part of the town has a small lake. It's mostly rectangular, but there are some protruding water tiles on top and bottom. Search the tile east from the protruding tiles on the south edge for a Fresh Water.

Finally, there's a Move Relearner in the Pokemon Centre.

Go north to Paniola Ranch.

--------------
PANIOLA RANCH:
--------------
Wild Pokemon: Mudbray, Miltank, Tauros, Herdier, Lillipup, *Alolan Geodude. Level 15-18.
Fishing (Old Rod): Wishiwashi and Alomomola.
Fishing (Good Rod): Pelipper and Gyarados.
Fishing (Super Rod): Pelipper, Gyarados, Wishiwashi, and Alomomola.

Go north and fight the first trainer.
MINOR ICONIC
Lady Anna
Magnezone LV 19

Follow the path to the end. There are two ways to continue: north and south. Go north first.

This is a pasture with some Miltank and Tauros grazing around. There are four items on the ground; from east to west they are an Oval Stone, an Amulet Coin, a Moomoo Milk, and a Mystic Water.

Return to the path and go south (after fighting a trainer who guards the way).
MINOR ICONIC
Lady Nina
Alolan Raichu LV 19

This part is a fairly big area with lots of grass. First of all, go to the SW grass patch and stand on the flower at the northern edge of the grass. From this flower, go two tiles south and check the western tile for a Fresh Water.
Go to the SW corner of this patch and go south along the fence, back to Paniola Town. Grab the Scope Lens at the end of the path.

After that, return to Paniola Ranch and go east. The next item is a visible Ether. After that, there is another hidden item: this big grass patch has a rectangular "dent" in its northern edge; stand in the SE corner of this dent and check the tile to your east for a Super Repel.

A final hidden item in this area is a Soda Pop. To find it, go to the NE corner (with a fenced Tauros) and search the second tile from the left in the northern row.

We're now done with this part, so go north past the next two trainers, in an optional double battle.
Tamer Gerald
Sableye LV 19
Carbink LV 18

Pokemon Breeder Amanda
Lillipup LV 18
Growlithe LV 18

The house here is where Kiawe lives, and it is also the Alolan branch of the Day Care.

This is the end of the way for now, as the path ahead is blocked by a herd of Miltank. So talk to Kiawe and fight him.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Kiawe
Charizard LV 20
Turtonator LV 21

Beating Kiawe has several consequences: Paniola Town will be added to Alola teleport system and his Charizard can now transport you at will between Route 1 and Paniola Ranch. That makes Alolan Day Care pretty convenient, arguably more so than the Sinnoh one!

Go to Kukui's house and sleep to start the next quest.

***************************************
* DAY 6 -- MALLOW AND MELEMELE MEADOW *
***************************************
The next day, talk to Kukui to learn that you are supposed to go to Route 3 and meet Mallow there. Go there and meet her. You can now go west into the trees to reach Melemele Meadow.

----------------
MELEMELE MEADOW:
----------------
Wild Pokemon: *Oricorio, Butterfree, Pikipek, Ledyba, Bewear, Murkrow. Level 17-20.

Another TR battle to start this.
ICONIC BATTLE
TR's Jessie & James
Mimikyu LV 20
Wobbuffet LV 50
Mareanie LV 20

Afterwards, grab the Yellow Nectar. Note that wild Pokemon can appear anywhere in the meadow.

Oricorio, who is very common here, has multiple forms. For now, you have access to two: its basic form is Fire/Flying, but if you have it hold the Yellow Nectar, it will transform into Electric/Flying form. It has two more forms, but you don't have the necessary items right now.

Go out, talk to Mallow and battle her.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Mallow
Steenee LV 22

Beating her will unlock a few things:
1. There's now a trainer next to the PC machine of the Pokemon School:
MINOR ICONIC
Youngster Hiroki
Mudbray LV 20
2. You can go to Kukui's House to unlock the next quest. But when you get there, Kukui will remind you of the ICONIC LV 20 Litten who used to block your way to some destinations. It will be close to Lillie's house in Hau'oli City. Go talk to it and it will join you.
3. Since we're in Hau'oli City anyway, let's go to the beach. There's now a new trainer here:
Rocker DJ Leo
Alolan Dugtrio LV 20
Alolan Diglett LV 19

Now head back to the lab and go to bed, and it's quest time!

********************
* DAY 7 -- GLADION *
********************
The next day, talk to Kukui to find out that you can spend the day off… until Rotom tells you to visit Lillie. Oh well, let’s do that. Go to her mansion in Hau’oli City. Her brother Gladion is there now, so fight him, as one is prone to do with people they see for the first time. No? It's just me? Moving on...
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Gladion
Lycanroc-Night LV 20

The Gladion fight is actually the only thing to do today -- go back to Kukui's House and sleep. And if you didn't go out of your way to get the Litten, it's right there near the mansion.

*****************************
* DAY 8 -- AKALA AND OLIVIA *
*****************************
Today, go to school. You'll learn that there's a field trip to Akala Island. That's the island where Paniola Town is, by the way.

The Charizard won't fly you to Paniola Ranch right now, so you have to take a ship. Go to Hau'oli City and walk all the way to the pier. There are two ships. You want to take the north one (well, it's the only one you CAN take), and go to Paniola.

Go north towards Paniola Ranch and Kukui will stop you to tell you that you should take on the trial at Brooklet Hill. So continue to Paniola Ranch.

At this point, the herd of Miltank that used to block your way by the Day Care has moo-ved. They still block your way south, but now you can at least go north to Route 5.

--------
ROUTE 5:
--------
Wild Pokemon: Wimpod, Cutiefly, *Crabrawler, Alolan Exeggutor, Grubbin, Ribombee, Butterfree. Level 18-21.

Crabrawler can only evolve in a certain location, but you haven't found it yet. I'll mention it when we get there.

This is another big and spacey Route, but it's actually fairly constrained in terms of your paths. Let's get to it.

From the start, go north and fight a trainer.
MINOR ICONIC
Gentleman Oluolu
Snorlax LV 22

After you beat him, he'll give you a Snorlium-Z.

Continue north to the next trainer.
Hiker Gabriel
Makuhita LV 22
Mudbray LV 22

Then go into the grass to the east. There's a Hyper Potion in this area.

Go back to the main path and follow it to the west. There's another trainer, and then a healer.
Pokemon Breeder Yuka
Morelull LV 22
Ledyba LV 22

The path splits now. We can go north, south, or west. We'll start by going north. First, fight a trainer.
Youngster Corey
Paras LV 22
Spinarak LV 22
Slowpoke LV 22

Then grab a Poisonium-Z from the center of the next grass patch. A pair of double trainers is further to the east.
Twins Isa & Nico
Happiny LV 23
Igglybuff LV 23

But before you jump the ledge there, go south and west into a dead end with a Super Potion.

Jump the ledge. There is a Revive in the grass patch. Jump the ledge to the south and then search the SW corner of this area to find a hidden Star Piece. Fight another trainer here and jump south to get back to the main path.
Youngster Caleb
Grubbin LV 22 x2

Go back to the crossroads, and this time, go south. Fight two trainers who guard the way in an optional double battle, then continue south.
Camper Justin
Vullaby LV 23

Picnicker Lauren
Rufflet LV 23

Go east to grab yet another Revive from the dead end, and then go west. Go into the trees to reach Brooklet Hill.

--------------
BROOKLET HILL:
--------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Magikarp and Feebas.
Fishing (Good Rod): Wishiwashi and Alomomola.
Fishing (Super Rod): Magikarp, Feebas, Wishiwashi, and Alomomola.

Lana is here, and you will fight her as soon as you go in.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Lana
Popplio LV 24

Then, agree to team up with her. Together, go north and check the boulder to fight the Totem Wishiwashi.
ICONIC BATTLE
Totem Pokemon Wishiwashi (Double Battle)
Wishiwashi LV 28
Alomomola LV 23

Exit the area, return to the crossroads on Road 5, and continue west to Route 8.

--------
ROUTE 8:
--------
Wild Pokemon: Alolan Geodude, Alolan Diglett, Lillipup, Garbodor, Herdier, Fearow, Yungoos. Level 21-24.
Fishing (Old Rod): Wishiwashi and Alomomola.
Fishing (Good Rod): Wimpod, Gyarados, and Wishiwashi.
Fishing (Super Rod): Wishiwashi, Alomomola, Wimpod, and Gyarados.

This is mostly just a scenic Route around a rock massif. First go west on a small peninsula and fight the trainer.
Picnicker Kiana
Eevee LV 24

After, talk to the next guy for a Water Stone.

Return to the main path. Grab a Dive Ball from the grass patch to the north, then continue west past another Trainer.
Lass Malie
Alolan Meowth LV 24

Continue west to the third trainer.
Bird Keeper Elleen
Wingull LV 24
Fearow LV 24

There are two hidden items here. One, a Max Repel, is in the NE corner of where the rock massif has been cut into. The other one, an Iron, is on the small 1-tile outcrop into the sea west of the trainer.

Continue north. There are two trainers on this path, as well as a Thunder Stone in a grass patch.
Youngster Miki
Bounsweet LV 23
Trumbeak LV 23

Youngster Aralan
Rockruff LV 24

The final part of this Route leads east. Once again, it has two trainers and an item in the grass (a Miracle Seed).
Lass Nicki
Miltank LV 24

Scientist Tyrone
Archen LV 24
Shieldon LV 24

Continue east to Route 7.

--------
ROUTE 7:
--------
Wild Pokemon: Alolan Geodude, Alolan Diglett, Lillipup, Garbodor, Herdier, Fearow, Yungoos. Level 21-24.
Fishing (Old Rod): Wishiwashi and Alomomola.
Fishing (Good Rod): Wimpod, Gyarados, and Wishiwashi.
Fishing (Super Rod): Wishiwashi, Alomomola, Wimpod, and Gyarados.

All encounters are the same as on Route 8.

Start by going east and fighting two trainers.
Swimmer Casey
Mareanie LV 26

Swimmer Dakota
Surskit LV 25
Dewpider LV 25

Be sure to grab the Buginium-Z in the southern corner before continuing on. Further east the path splits. Go east. Fight a trainer and grab a Rare Candy in the grass.
Swimmer Tiare
Alomomola LV 25
Shellder LV 25
Corsola LV 25

Then fight the pair of double trainers.
Cool Couple Zero & Chloe
Zorua LV 25
Rockruff LV 25

Further east is the Wela Volcano Park. (If the path is blocked, it means that you haven't beaten Totem Wishiwashi yet.)

------------------
WELA VOLCANO PARK:
------------------
Wild Pokemon: Alolan Marowak, Cubone, Magcargo, Magby, Salandit, Ponyta. Level 22-24.

Go north. The path splits here and each side is guarded by a trainer.
Cool Trainer Jim
Alolan Meowth LV 25
Kadabra LV 25

Hiker Colhoun
Roggenrola LV 25
Machop LV 25

Beat both of them and grab the items in the side paths TM127 (Leech Seed) on the west side, a Charcoal on the east side). Then continue north and fight Kiawe.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Kiawe
Charizard LV 23
Alolan Marowak LV 25
Turtonator LV 25

According to Kiawe, there wasn’t actually a trial here. Huh. Go back down, west along Route 7 and south into the northern part of Route 5.

--------
ROUTE 5:
--------
Go south, then east. There is a trainer and a Bright Powder in the eastern part of this area.
Cool Trainer Alexis
Goomy LV 25
Sylveon LV 25

Be careful to not fall down the ledge -- you'd have to go around Routes 8 and 7 again to return and while it's a safe path, it's long and annoying.

Enter the forest once you get the Bright Powder. (If the path is blocked, then you haven't beaten Kiawe on Wela Volcano yet.)

------------
LUSH JUNGLE:
------------
Wild Pokemon: *Fomantis, Alolan Diglett, Castform, Lurantis, Parasect. Level 22-24.

This is a "cave" area so wild Pokemon can appear anywhere. There is a Mossy Rock here, so Eevee can evolve into Leafeon when leveled up here.

Once you enter, you will have to fight Mallow.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Mallow
Steenee LV 27

Then continue north and fight Totem Lurantis.
ICONIC BATTLE
Totem Pokemon Lurantis (2v2)
Lurantis LV 30
Castform LV 25

You will get a Grassium-Z for beating it.

Now that you have beaten Totem Lurantis, two things happen. First of all, Kiawe is no longer at the Wela Volcano. That means you can get to his Charizard. Charizard is like an alternate teleport system in Alola; right now it connects three places: Route 1, Paniola Ranch, and Wela Volcano. You need to get to Paniola Ranch -- better way is to go on foot, as you can stop by the healer on Route 5.

The second thing that happens is that the herd of Miltank at Paniola Ranch moves again, letting you go south.

--------------
PANIOLA RANCH:
--------------
The new section is pretty short, consisting just of trainers -- five of them!
Fisherman Vernon
Starmie LV 26
Gyarados LV 25

ICONIC BATTLE
Youngster Horacio (Sophocles's Rival)
Charjabug LV 27 (Shiny)

Youngster Anthon
Magby LV 25
Yungoos LV 26

Beauty Brit
Cubone LV 26
Drowzee LV 25

MINOR ICONIC
Beauty Ida
Brionne LV 27

Continue south to Ruins of Life.

--------------
RUINS OF LIFE:
--------------
To your east is a legendary, Tapu Lele. It's only LV 25, so a relatively easy catch. If you have high levelled pokemon (which you should), then Level Balls are the way to go.

Once you've caught it, the only thing left to do here is to fight Olivia.
ICONIC BATTLE
ISLAND KAHUNA OLIVIA (Double Battle) (2v2)
Lycanroc LV 26
Probopass LV 26

Beat her to receive the Rockium-Z.

This concludes the Akala quest. Go to Kukui's House and sleep.

**********************
* DAY 9 -- SOPHOCLES *
**********************
The next day, Kukui sends you to Sophocles's house -- remember? It's the second house in Hau'oli City when you go from Route 1. Fight him.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Sophocles
Togedemaru LV 26
Charjabug LV 26

And... that's it? Yeah, it's another day done, go to Kukui's House and sleep, then.

***************************
* DAY 10 -- BACK IN KANTO *
***************************
So, the next day, Kukui's gone. Go to school. You'll learn that you're going to Pallet Town to see Kantoian forms. Unfortunately, the convenient inter-regional teleport doesn't work, so you'll have to take the blimp. Go to Viridian City and walk home.

------------
PALLET TOWN:
------------
Go to Oak's Laboratory where you are welcomed by TR. Isn't it nice how those guys try?
ICONIC BATTLE
TR's Jessie & James
Mimikyu LV 27
Wobbuffet LV 51
Mareanie LV 27

So, after their inevitable blasting off, go through the lab and exit through the back into the corral.

In the corral, you can talk to Oak, Samson, Kukui, and your classmates, but the main thing to do here is to fight Misty and Brock.
ICONIC BATTLE
Gym Leader Misty
Gyarados LV 55 (Mega)

ICONIC BATTLE
Breeder Brock
Steelix LV 55 (Mega)

(Don't forget that Oak's Lab has a healing machine and a PC!) Once you beat both of them, you will automatically return to Kukui's House in Alola. Go to bed.

*******************
* DAY 11 -- NEBBY *
*******************
The next day, Kukui has no task for you, but Rotom Dex suggests you should go to Melemele Forest.

In the forest, go south. Close to the first trainer is a Pokemon -- it's tiny, so you might have problems seeing it. Talk to it and it will start following you.

Note that while it follows you, you must take at least one step into a building, or else when you exit it, you will get a black screen. Ideally you want to avoid this, but if you get a black screen, immediately go back into the building, go in one step, and it should be fixed when you exit again.

Now go to Lillie's house in Hau'oli City and fight her.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Lillie
Alolan Vulpix (Snowy) LV 27

She suggests taking it to Kukui, so head back to the lab. He doesn't know what to do, so suggests that you sleep on it.

*****************************
* DAY 12 -- AETHER PARADISE *
*****************************
The next day, you're told to go to school. This time, we're going to Aether Paradise!

Go to Hau'oli City and to the sailor who sails to Paniola Town. He now has Aether Paradise as another destination.

----------------
AETHER PARADISE:
----------------
Wild Pokemon: Bounsweet, *Stufful, Ditto, Petilil, *Comfey, Alolan Exeggutor, Sandygast, Jigglypuff, Sandile. Level 23-28.

Fishing (Old Rod): Shellos and Qwilfish.
Fishing (Good Rod): Swanna, Goldeen, and Wishiwashi.
Fishing (Super Rod): Shellos, Qwilfish, Swanna, Goldeen, and Wishiwashi.

Stufful is the first form of Bewear, which appeared in a few areas, so the only completely new Pokemon here is Comfey.

From where you start, you can go west or east and then south to the grass patches. East patch has an item at the end of it. The eastern path has a Groundium-Z. The western path has TM130 (Shore Up). 

Now let's head into the building. Or you can go north and enter the big building...

From the start, you will meet the researcher Faba. Once you're done, you have a PC on your left. You can't go east, so go north and then east to a small office with a Rare Candy. It was probably someone's lunch and you just pilfered it. I hope you're happy.

The guy at the north end of the big room is a healer.

Go west and fight a trainer.
Scientist Teddy
Alolan Dugtrio LV 28
Sliggoo LV 28

The path leads you around, past two more trainers.
Scientist Jari
Herdier LV 28
Lumineon LV 28

Scientist Ashton
Shelgon LV 28
Trumbeak LV 28

Be sure to pick up the Max Revive in the SW Corner. Continue east and fight another trainer.
Scientist Arin
Alolan Muk LV 29

The small room to the north contains a Full Restore.

Continue east. The path goes further east, but go south first. Fight a trainer that guards the entrance to another office with a Nugget.
Past him is a man next to a desk: he will trade you a Togedemaru for an Alolan Pichu, or so he claims. Unfortunately, due to the removal of Alolan Pichu, this trade doesn’t work anymore, so now the only other way to get Togedemaru in Fire Ash is by catching one in the Alola section of the Safari Zone, which you'll have access to in a bit.
Scientist Danny
Parasect LV 28
Drifblim LV 28
Vibrava LV 28

Go back to the main path and continue east past two more trainers in a double battle.
Scientists Willington & Billington
Electabuzz LV 29
Magmar LV 29

Grab a Dubious Disc there (you should already have some from Slateport MARKET). Two researchers at the counter sell all types of fossils including two new ones: Jaw Fossil and Sail Fossil.
Continue along the path and Faba will stop you when you go past him. You will automatically go back to Kukui's House.

Go back to Aether Paradise -- we're not done here yet. Now directly east from the entrance is another room, which has a free Type: Null at LV 30. Grab it. Continue east along the southern wall to grab a Master Ball!

Now you can go back to Kukui's House and sleep.

****************************
* DAY 13 -- TEN CARAT HILL *
****************************
The next day, Kukui will tell you that he has a fun lesson plan. Then Cosmog teleports you away.

Welp.

Welcome to Ten Carat Hill!

---------------
TEN CARAT HILL:
---------------
Wild Pokemon: Pinsir, Magmar, Midday Lycanroc, Midnight Lycanroc, Alolan Raticate, Spinda, Sableye, Pangoro, Machop. Level 24-29.

Wild Pokemon encounters can occur anywhere here.

Follow the path east, south, and west, facing three trainers and grabbing the Ether along the way.
Youngster Honus
Rockruff LV 30

Youngster Ikaika
Pikipek LV 29
Yungoos LV 29

Lass Ellie

Rockruff LV 29

After the third trainer, continue west to grab an Elixir, then return to the trainer and go south and east.

Fight the next trainer and continue east.
Lass Sheri
Jangmo-o LV 29
Pikachu LV 29

You'll end up on a meadow. Grab the Fightinium-Z at the east side and talk to Gladion to fight him.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Gladion
Type: Null (Silvally) LV 31

Note that although his pokemon is named Silvally, it is a Type: Null.

He will send you back to Route 1 afterwards. From now on, Charizard will have Ten Carat Hill as a new destination.

Go back to Kukui's House and sleep.

**************************************************
* DAY 14 -- FABA, NIHILEGO, AND VAST PONI CANYON *
**************************************************
The next day, you are supposed to go to Aether Paradise and visit Faba. Do so.

Aaaand Faba goes all villainy and steals Nebby. Go to the building and you will be thrown into a battle with a LV 35 Nihilego. Catch it.

Nothing more to do here, go to Kukui's House. No sleeping, though -- Kukui will tell you that you're going to Poni island. Return back to the sailor in Hau'oli City: he now has a new destination, Vast Poni Canyon!

-----------------
VAST PONI CANYON:
-----------------
Wild Pokemon: *Jangmo-o, Hakamo-o, Mienfoo, Carbink, Kommo-o, Machoke, Golbat, Night Lycanroc, Day Lycanroc, Machop. Level 24-29.

This is a location with strong magnetic fields, and as such it allows the evolution of Magneton, Nosepass, and Charjabug.

Once again, random encounters can occur everywhere here. Start by going east and north and fight a trainer.
Cool Trainer Lynn
Staryu LV 29
Shiinotic LV 29
Fletchinder LV 29

Continue west. There will be another trainer and a Dragonium-Z in the dead end. 
Scientist Iki
Muk LV 29
Magneton LV 29

Return to the first trainer. East from her (you have to go around a rock) is an X Attack. Just to the north is a Move Tutor for Magnet Rise.

Go north and west through a narrow gap to the next area. You'll fight a trainer.
Hiker Zachary
Archeops LV 29
Cranidos LV 29

Continue west to a dead end with a trainer and a Max Revive.
Black Belt Earl
Poliwrath LV 30

Return to the previous trainer and continue north. There's another trainer.
Painter Perdy
Whimsicott LV 30

Beyond her, the path splits. Go through the western part; fight the trainer and grab a PP Max nearby.
Cool Trainer Harry
Torkoal LV 29
Arcanine LV 29

Then go back and enter the eastern branch. It has a Protein and a pair of double trainers.
Cool Couple Kent & Aimee
Alolan Sandslash LV 30
Alolan Ninetales LV 30

Go east, north, and west around the rock formation to fight another trainer, making sure to grab the TM126 (Liquidation).
Cool Trainer Junko
Lilligant LV 29
Sneasel LV 29

The last trainer is west of you and there's a Revive close to him.
Cool Trainer Eric
Granbull LV 29
Alolan Golem LV 29
Cloyster LV 29

That's all on the outside, enter the cave! Inside, go straight north, but make sure to grab the Pikashunium-Z. Talk to Solgaleo, who will give you a Solganium-Z. It then automatically heals you (although you won't get a message about it). Agree to go to Ultra Deep Space, and once there, go north and fight Lusamine.
ICONIC BATTLE
Aether President Lusamine
Clefable LV 33
Milotic LV 33
Absol LV 33
Salazzle LV 33
Lilligant LV 33
Mismagius LV 33

After you win, you will get back to Altar of the Sunne.

Once you get back, you will automatically go back to Kukui's House. Which is a bit of a bummer, since you want to go back to the Vast Poni Canyon, all the way to the cave and talk to Solgaleo in order to obtain it.
Gift Solgaleo LV 30

And then go all the way back to Kukui's House to sleep.

****************************
* DAY 15 -- MOUNT LANAKILA *
****************************
The next day, follow Rotom Dex's suggestion and go to school. Kukui will announce a new trip. Go to the sailor you've been using and he will now be able to transport you to Mount Lanakila.

---------------
MOUNT LANAKILA:
---------------
Weather forecast: Blizzard

Wild Pokemon: *Alolan Vulpix, Sneasel, *Alolan Sandshrew, Crabominable, Snorunt. Level 25-30.

This is a place with an Icy Rock, so Eevee can evolve here into Glaceon. In addition, this is the only place where Crabrawler can evolve into Crabominable.

Directly west from where you started is a Move Tutor for Iron Head.

Start by going west. and south to fight a trainer.
Crush Girl Kailee
Shiinotic LV 30
Passimian LV 30

Further west is an Iron. North of you is a 3x5 grass patch. Stand north of its NE corner, go one step west and check the tile north of you for a Revival Herb.

Go west and south to another trainer.
Black Belt Seth
Scyther LV 30
Malamar LV 30

Go south from the trainer to reach an Ice Stone. Then go east for another trainer.
Hiker Ovid

Hiker Minty
Florges LV 32

MINOR ICONIC
Cool Trainer Cerah
Alolan Ninetales LV 32

Then go west for the final trainer.
Youngster Peren
Emolga LV 32

Well, not the FINAL final trainer -- north from there, in a dead end, is Lillie. Fight her.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Lillie
Alolan Vulpix (Snowy) LV 32

Now you can return north to the sailor and go home. Go to Kukui's House and sleep. 

Note that when you pass back through Hau'oli City, there is a pokeball containing a LV 30 Marshadow next to the Pokemon Centre. Be sure to grab it.

**********************
* DAY 16 -- BUZZWOLE *
**********************
Head to school. Lusamine announces that you can now battle Ultra Beasts that wander around Alola. Go to the northeast corner of the classroom. There will be a new NPC who sells you Beast Balls; these special Poke Balls are great for catching Ultra Beasts, but don't really work that well on anything else. They cost just 300, so you can just buy as many as you want. By this time you are most likely at the money cap which means you are single-handedly supporting the whole Pokemon world economy.

Now go to Melemele Meadow (over the bridge to Route 3, and then west into the trees). Fight Buzzwole which appears there. Catch it. Try your new Beast Balls.
Buzzwole LV 37

Once you do that, go to Kukui's House and sleep.

**************************
* DAY 17 -- ROYAL AVENUE *
**************************
The next day, take the Charizard to Paniola Ranch. The herd of Miltank is finally gone, so you can go east from the ranch and enter Royal Avenue!

-------------
ROYAL AVENUE:
-------------
Royal Avenue is basically a small town. There is a Move Tutor (for Gunk Shot) in the Pokemon Centre.

Outside, you can collect five items, two hidden and three visible:

1) Rare Candy -- The northern edge of Royal Avenue is formed by trees and bushes. A Rare Candy is hidden in the third bush from the left.
2) Rare Candy -- Another one is hidden in the third bush from the right.
3) HP Up -- on the ground near the second Rare Candy.
4) Pink Nectar -- near the fountain in the center of Royal Avenue. Pink Nectar can be equipped on Oricorio to change it into its Psychic/Flying form.
5) TM132 (Revenge) -- in the SE corner in the puddle.

Go north from the Ultra Ball and enter the house. The man inside will give you a Power Belt.

East of the house is a guy who will give you the Incinium-Z. The hiker by the fountain will give you a Primarium-Z. The fisherman north of the Pokemon Centre will give you a Decidium-Z.

There is a Game Corner in the eastern part of the Avenue. The Pokemon offered there are:
*Alolan Grimer - 180 coins
Rockruff - 500 coins
Jangmo-o - 2800 coins
*Turtonator - 5500 coins
*Komala - 9999 coins

Note that Komala is not available anywhere else and that the only other place to get an Alolan Grimer or a Tutonator is the Safari Zone. However, Turtonator only has a 1% chance to show up in the Safari Zone, so you'll probably need to get it here if you want one.

Now enter the big building to the north. Talk to the guy in the middle and you get a choice of pairing with either Kiawe or Sophocles for the next battle. Choose whoever -- the one you don't choose will be the partner of your opponent. 
Beat the Masked Royal and that's another day done.
ICONIC BATTLE
Masked Royal & Pokemon Trainer Kiawe / Sophocles
Incineroar LV 33
Alolan Marowak LV 33 / Charjabug LV 33

The Alola teleport system is also updated, adding Royal Avenue. Head back towards the school via the teleport system for a good night's sleep... except that TS has taken over the place. Three grunts guard the road to the school.
TS Sipp
Alolan Rattata LV 33
Alolan Raticate LV 33
Yungoos LV 33
Spinarak LV 33

TS Hipp
Houndour LV 33
Ekans LV 33
Drowzee LV 33

MINOR ICONIC
TS Okazaki (No known pokemon in anime)
Golbat LV 33
Scraggy LV 33

The 'leaders' of this strike force are next to the school entrance, guarding Ilima.
ICONIC BATTLE
TS Tupp, Rapp, & Zipp
Salandit LV 33
Garbodor LV 33
Zubat LV 33
Yungoos LV 30

Illima will then give you an Eevium-Z, and then he tells you about the Alola Pokemon League that's being set up. Exciting prospect. For now though, let's head to sleep.

*********************
* DAY 18 -- POIPOLE *
*********************
The next day, Kukui will tell you that an Ultra Beast appeared on the island and Rotom Dex reveals that it's inside the school! So, let's go there. Rotom Dex gives you a hint once you enter - the Ultra Beast is in the plants on the right side of the school.

There's a small room you can reach by going east from the classroom, then south -- there was no reason coming here before. Once you enter the room, you will see an ICONIC Poipole on the right. It's another gift pokemon, so grab it. It even comes in a Beast Ball.

Poipole, unlike the rest of the Ultra Beasts, is able to evolve. To evolve it, you must teach it Dragon Pulse, but it actually doesn't learn it by leveling up. Dragon Pulse is Lv. 1 move, so you need to take Poipole to one of the many Move Relearners and get it there. For those people who want to have a complete dex listing in their PC's with all possible pokemon, however, do NOT evolve Poipole, as you will receive a Gift Naganadel towards the end of the Alola Region.

As a reminder, in case you don't want to go searching through this guide for them, there is a Move Relearner in Blackthorn City in Johto. I chose it because it is, in my opinion, the easiest to find.

Anyways, that's today's quest done. Go back to Kukui's House and sleep.

*************************************************
* DAY 19 -- CELESTEELA, KIAWE, LANA, AND MALLOW *
*************************************************
The next day, Rotom Dex informs you about another Ultra Beast, sighted at Route 3. So -- go there. From the entrance, go north, up the big set of stairs to the plateau. There is a new trainer at the base waiting to challenge you.
MINOR ICONIC
Black Belt Ikari
Mienshao LV 33

Continue north and west. Sophocles wants the Ultra Beast for himself and you have to fight him.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Sophocles
Togedemaru LV 36
Charjabug LV 36

Beat him, then fight and catch Celesteela!
Celesteela LV 34

Rotom Dex suggests visiting Kiawe on the farm, so go back to Route 1 and take Charizard to Paniola Ranch. Kiawe is right there, so fight him.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Kiawe
Charizard LV 34
Alolan Marowak LV 36
Turtonator LV 36

After you beat Kiawe, Rotom Dex sends you to Route 1 where Lana is. She is SW from Kukui's house, by the sea. Fight her.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Lana
Popplio LV 37

Next, Rotom Dex sends you to Aina's Kitchen in Hau'oli City (it's the fancy house on the western side of the city), where you will fight Mallow.
Pokemon Trainer Mallow
Steenee LV 37

After that, go to Kukui's House and sleep.

*************************************
* DAY 20 -- ULA'ULA ISLAND AND NANU *
*************************************
The next day, Kukui tells you that you will be going to Ula'ula Island today. Go to Hau'oli City and this time, talk to the BOTTOM sailor to sail for Tapu Village!

-------------
TAPU VILLAGE:
-------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Tentacool and Finneon.
Fishing (Good Rod): Bruxish and Wishiwashi.
Fishing (Super Rod): Tentacool, Finneon, Bruxish, and Wishiwashi.

First of all, enter the house NE from you and talk to Nanu.
ICONIC BATTLE
ISLAND KAHUNA NANU (1v1)
Krookodile LV 33

He will fight you. This will also update the Alolan teleport system, adding the Tapu Village Pokemon Centre. Then, go out and talk to the lady east from the house to obtain a Razor Claw.
There are three paths out of the village, but the NW one is blocked. Go through the NE path first to Haina Desert.

-------------
HAINA DESERT:
-------------
Weather forecast: Sandstorm

Wild Pokemon: Trapinch, Sandile, Mudsdale, Alolan Dugtrio, Alolan Diglett. Level 27-32.

Wild Pokemon encounters can happen anywhere in the desert.
As soon as you enter, you will speak to Acerola. She tells you to head through the desert to the Ruins of Abundance, where Tapu Bulu is at.

This place is not too bad: a few trainers, and a bunch of items -- and they are all visible too!

From the start, go west and grab a Big Nugget. Then go northeast and get a Moon Stone.

Go east, fight a trainer and grab an Aloraichium-Z he guards.
Cool Trainer Voltsy
Zoroark LV 31
Charizard (Mega X) LV 31
Gardevoir LV 31

Then go west and north for a Max Elixir and another trainer.
Sailor Al
Wishiwashi LV 31
Whiscash LV 31
Krokorok LV 31

Then go west, north, and east around the rock formation to your north to grab the last item: a Hyper Potion. Then go north and east, and then north through the exit.

-------------------
RUINS OF ABUNDANCE:
-------------------
Go to Tapu Bulu, fight it, and catch it. Tapu Bulu is neither fast nor heavy, and it’s level 35, so Timer Balls are the way to go.
Tapu Bulu LV 35

Then return through the desert to Tapu Village. Nanu won't fight you again yet -- if you talk to him, he tells you to go to Thrifty Megamart, and find some people who were looking for you. So leave the village through the southern exit to Route 14.

---------
ROUTE 14:
---------
Wild Pokemon: Cutiefly, Drampa, Salandit, Gengar, Blissey. Level 27-32.
Fishing (Old Rod): Tentacool and Finneon.
Fishing (Good Rod): Bruxish and Wishiwashi.

Right at the start, grab a Max Potion. Go south and east along the path, beating three trainers along the way.
Swimmer Keoni
Pyukumuku LV 33

Fisherman Hisato
Feebas LV 31
Gyarados LV 31

Poke Maniac Kawika
Togedemaru LV 31
Gabite LV 31

Thrifty Megamart is at the end the biker outside is a Move Tutor for Twister. Grab a Max Revive to the west before you go in.

Inside is... another TR battle. Yay?
ICONIC BATTLE
TR's Jessie & James (1v1)
Mimikyu LV 34

After you beat them, Acerola outside the Megamart will give you TM128 (Night Shade). Then go back to Tapu Village and fight Nanu again. Note that this time, he fights you in a 1v3. All three of his pokemon, vs just ONE of yours, so choose carefully.
ICONIC BATTLE
ISLAND KAHUNA NANU (1v3)
Krookodile LV 33
Sableye LV 33
Alolan Persian LV 33

You will get the Lycanium-Z when you defeat him.

Wild Pokemon: Alolan Grimer, Togedemaru, Alolan Graveler, Comfey, Alolan Vulpix, Steenee, Shiinotic, Passimian, Oranguru, Jangmo-o, Drampa, Turtonator.
Fishing (Old Rod): Pyukumuku, Wimpod.
Fishing (Good Rod): Bruxish, Mareanie, Dhelmise.
Fishing (Super Rod): Pyukumuku, Wimpod, Bruxish, Mareanie, Dhelmise.

As stated before, this is the only location where you can catch a Togedemaru for yourself at the moment.

There are 2 items: A PP Max and an Ice Stone. There's also a hidden Nugget: It's in the bush NW of the lake in the SW corner.

When you've caught what you want, head back to Kukui's House and sleep.

**************************************************************************
* DAY 21 -- XURKITREE, BLACEPHALON, MOUNT HOKULANI, AND THE MASKED ROYAL *
**************************************************************************
Kukui tells you that two Ultra Beasts were seen. Go to Route 2. Xurkitree and Blacephalon are at the shore in the NE part of the Route. Catch them and return to Kukui's House.
Xurkitree LV 35
Blacephalon LV 35

Now that errand is done, head to the lab. When you pass through Hau'oli City, you'll notice that the person who was guarding the easternmost house on the road has left. You can now enter and grab whatever is inside. It turns out to be... a Cosmog! This will come in handy if you're trying to have a living dex. Talk to Kukui and you'll be told that you're going to Hokulani Observatory now. To get there, first take the ship from Hau'oli City to Mount Lanakila. Go west and enter the cave that used to be blocked by a Boldore.

--------------------
MOUNT LANAKILA CAVE:
--------------------
Wild Pokemon: Alolan Sandshrew, Boldore, Alolan Raticate, Tyranitar, Alolan Sandslash. Level 29-32.

You start at an ice maze that has a Ghostium-Z in it. Go north and west to another ice maze. This one has Never-Melt Ice. In addition, once you collect it, go straight south and check the rock that stops you for an Ice Heal.

Go south, down the stairs, NW, then up the stairs for another ice maze. This one contains an Iron in the NW corner and TM124 (Arm Thrust) SE of that.

The next area is fairly open. It has the last ice field (but that one has nothing interesting). There is a Rare Candy hidden in a rock. Walk south from the northern ice maze and check the second rock to your east you pass (it's SW from the first rock).

Exit south to Mount Hokulani.

---------------
MOUNT HOKULANI:
---------------
Wild Pokemon: *Minior, Alolan Dugtrio, Ditto, Skarmory. Level 32.

While this is a pretty large area, you can only move along a narrow path. First you'll see a boulder that hides a Moon Ball, then fight a trainer next to it.
Picnicker Jessica
Clefairy LV 35

The next boulder hides a Heavy Ball. There's a hole in the fence that leads to a grass patch and another trainer.
Poke Maniac Sky
Minior LV 33 x3

Go west and north from the hole for another two trainers.
Hiker Thomas
Alolan Geodude LV 35

Poke Maniac Todd
Passimian LV 33
Oranguru LV 33

Grab a Level Ball from the boulder there. Continue north to the final area.

Grab a Fast Ball from the boulder on your right -- that's the only boulder here that hides anything. The class is here, so talk to Kukui. You missed the tour. Bummer. Nothing to do but to go back. Lillie will ambush you once you enter the Mount Lanakila Cave and fight you.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Lillie
Alolan Vulpix (Snowy) LV 36

Go back to Kukui's House and talk to Kukui. He'll send you to the Royal Avenue Battle Dome. Once there, you will team up with the Masked Royal. Beat the two trainers.

* DAY 22: MINA AND STAKATAKA *
******************************
Today, Rotom suggests you head to the market in Hau'oli City. As you approach Lillie's mansion, you'll notice TS agents up to their usual business. This time, they're cornering a girl named Mina. Crush them.
ICONIC BATTLE
TS Tupp, Rapp, & Zipp
Salandit LV 37
Zubat LV 37
Yungoos LV 34
Garbodor LV 37

After they leave, Mina thanks you for your help and tells you about a strange pokemon hanging out near the school. Before we do that, talk to a new guy south of the Pokemon Center. He will give you a Fairium-Z. Now let’s head back to Aether Paradise as another new guy shows up there. Left of the person who was supposed to trade you a Togedemaru, there is a guy who will give you a Mewnium-Z. Now let’s head back to school. Stakataka is south of the school entrance. Let's fight (and catch) it.
Stakataka LV 40

That's all for today. Let's get some shut-eye.

****************************************************
* DAY 23: TR's MATORI MATRIX, LUNALA, AND NECROZMA *
****************************************************
The next day, Kukui is tired. Go to the school to learn that all adults are like that. You will have to go to Altar of the Sunne. Go to Hau'oli City and sail to Vast Poni Canyon. 
The canyon, however, has been overrun by TR Members. You'll face off against them as you make your way through the canyon. There are three grunts on the main path.

Head inside the cave, and proceed north to Lunala. Make sure to grab the Lunalium-Z on your way. Fight and catch it - it's not heavy or fast so Timer Balls are recommended.
Lunala LV 42

Then talk to Lunala to enter Ultra Deep Space. There is Necrozma at the north end; catch it with Heavy Balls.
Necrozma LV 45

Once you've caught it, everything returns to normal. Now that everyone is awake... it's time to go home and sleep.

******************************************************************
* DAY 24: HAU, TAPU KOKO & GUZZLORD, AND VISITS FROM OLD FRIENDS *

MINOR ICONIC
Lass Pikala
Pikachu LV 37 x4
Pikachu LV 37 (Curly)
Pikachu LV 38 (Boss) (shiny)

Once you beat her, she'll give you the Pikanium-Z.

You meet Hau in the large clearing. Fight him.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Hau
Dartrix LV 40

Afterwards, return to Route 1. Tapu Koko is right outside the School. Catch it. Note that Tapu Koko has the move Wild Charge, which does recoil damage, so it's risky to reduce it to 1HP. It's fast, so fast balls are recommended.
Tapu Koko LV 40

Immediately after that battle, you are transported by Tapu Koko to the Ultra Ruin and face a trainer with a Zeraora.
MINOR ICONIC
Cool Trainer Dia
Zeraora LV 40

After beating him he tells you of a Guzzlord that must be defeated before you can return to your world. Head north and catch the Guzzlord. As it's an Ultra Beast, Beast Balls are the best method of capture.
Guzzlord LV 45

After catching Guzzlord, you are transported back to Route 1 where you faced Tapu Koko. Rotom tells you that he just got a message from Kukui to head to the school for a 'surprise'.

The surprise turns out to be Misty, who has come to Alola on vacation. Fight her.

That's it for today. Let's head back to Kukui's house and sleep.

**************************
* DAY 25: MY LITTLE PONI *
**************************
Go to school and sit in your spot to learn that you are going to Poni Island today -- and your goal is to do the final Grand Trial. So let's get to it! Go to Hau'oli City and talk to the bottom sailor (the one who can get you to Tapu Village). He will have a new destination now: Seafolk Village.

----------------
SEAFOLK VILLAGE:
----------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Wingull.
Fishing (Good Rod): Relicanth, Wailmer, and Dhelmise.
Fishing (Super Rod): Wingull, Relicanth, Wailmer, and Dhelmise.

When you arrive in the Seafolk Village harbor, go north and west along the 2nd pier. The man in the house will give you a Nugget. On the central platform is a girl who will give you a Smoke Ball.

To the west of the central platform, there's a dead end with a Waterium-Z. 

To the east of the central platform is a ship moored on the easterm pier. Inside, there are several cabins with trainers and items. In the main hallway, there's an older guy who'll give you a Mimikium-Z.

First cabin has 1 trainer and a Magmarizer.
Swimmer Marcus
Exeggcute LV 38 (shiny)

Second cabin has nothing, but the third cabin has another trainer and an Electirizer.
Tuber Kira
Sylveon LV 38

Towards the end of the hall is a vendor who will sell you Heart Scales for 100 apiece. That's all inside the ship, so head back outside.

Note that both ships can be entered, but the other ship is full of nothing but NPCs, so nothing of note.

Outside the Pokemon Centre is a Move Tutor for Seed Bomb. The center itself has a tuber that will give you a Lucky Punch.

Now head north into the Poni Wilds.

-----------
PONI WILDS:
-----------
Wild Pokemon: Oricorio, Trumbeak, Spinarak, Granbull, Gumshoos, Pinsir. Level 30-38.
Fishing (Old Rod): Wingull and Wishiwashi.
Fishing (Good Rod): Relicanth, Golduck, and *Meltan.
Fishing (Super Rod): Wingull, Wishiwashi, Relicanth, Golduck, and *Meltan.

Let's start by going west past a grass patch. There is a guy guarding the top of the stairs who won't let you pass without a Meltan, so we'll come back to him later. For now, head north and face a trainer.
Sailor Fil
Parasect LV 38
Ribombee LV 38

Grab the Rare Candy in the NW corner. There is also a hidden Big Pearl on the one empty tile inside a grass patch. Afterwards, retrace your steps back to the dock entrance.

This time, go east and north. Grab the Purple Nectar in the grass patch, then go further north to grab the Dusk Stone in the clearing.

Head east and face a trainer.
Painter Cara
Oricorio LV 38 (Sensu)

Continue east and pick up the TM123 (Slack Off) in the grass patch beyond the clump of trees. 

Head south and you'll see a ledge that can take you back to the entrance if you need to heal up. Continue east past two trainers that can be fought as a team if you choose to.
Cool Trainer Lindsey
Garbodor LV 38
Toxapex LV 38

Cool Trainer Kekoa
Skarmory LV 38
Sharpedo LV 38

Continue east and grab the Repeat Ball. Head north up onto the plateau and grab two items, a Babiri Berry and a Wacan Berry.

Head back south and now continue on east to the Ancient Poni Path.

------------------
ANCIENT PONI PATH:
------------------
Wild Pokemon: Oricorio, Trumbeak, Spinarak, Granbull, Gumshoos, Pinsir. Level 30-38.

First things first is to face off against TS who is guarding the entrance into the barren farm.
ICONIC BATTLE
TS Tupp, Rapp, & Zipp
Salandit LV 39
Zubat LV 39
Yungoos LV 35
Garbodor LV 39

Now that they're taken care of, go north through the fence and into the barren farm.

There are many Berry Patches here. We haven't seen these in a while, and these will be the last ones we'll find throughout the game. Feeling the nostalgia yet?

From left to right, they contain: 80 Hondew Berries, 8 Pamtre Berries, 80 Watmel Berries, 80 Apicot, Enigma, Durin, Liechi Berries, 2 Pecha Berries... then no berries? Oh wait, there's a hidden Revival Herb! Then there's 80 Belue Berries, 8 Cheri Berries, 80 Figy Berries, 8 Occa Berries, 80 Tamato Berries and 8 Payapa Berries. Excellent patch for the final one. 10/10.

Then, grab the visible PP Up, and then talk to Hapu, who accuses you of stealing her crops. You must fight her to convince her you mean no harm... weird logic, I know.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Hapu
Golurk LV 40

She tells you that she can't help you find the Island Kahuna at the moment, and Rotom Dex suggests that you return to Seafolk Village and inquire there.

Before you do so, there are several trainers and items that we can grab here.

Go back to the path and continue east until you hit the woods. In the grass patch south of you is a Shiny Stone.

North of the grass patch are a pair of guards blocking the entrance to Tapu Fini's home, so we'll leave it alone for now.

Ignore the northern path for now and head back to Seafolk Village. Lillie is waiting for you in the central plaza. Beat her.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Lillie
Alolan Vulpix (Snowy) LV 38

After fighting her, she tells you to talk to Gladion, her brother, who is back on the Ancient Poni Path.

Head back to the 3-way intersection on the Ancient Poni Path. Then head north and face the two trainers on the path.
Lass Aviar
Oricorio LV 36 x4 (all forms)

Poke Maniac Raymond
Turtonator LV 38
Drampa LV 38

After them, you encounter Gladion again. Beat him.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Gladion
Lycanroc-Night LV 39

The boat at the end of the path is now accessible as a route to the Vast Poni Canyon. As you travel through the canyon again, go east, north, and west at the second fork. Here, roughly in the center of the area, you will find Sophocles. Fight him.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Sophocles
Togedemaru LV 37
Vikavolt LV 39

After beating him, he sends you to ask Lana about the Kahuna. Lana is at the Beach in the Poni Wilds, so return there. The guard by the western stairs who wanted to see a Meltan now allows you through (despite not actually having a Meltan). This means that you can also finally fish here and catch yourself a Meltan. But the real reason you're here is to fight Lana who appears next to the northern big rock.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Lana
Brionne LV 39
Eevee LV 38 (Sandy)

She, too, does not know where the Island Kahuna is, but recommends that you should fight Tapu Fini now. Before you leave, check two tiles right and three tiles north from here to find a hidden Rare Candy.

The two guards at the western end of the Ancient Poni Path are now gone, allowing you to face Tapu Fini. Before you can face it though, you must fight Mallow, who is standing guard outside the entrance.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Mallow
Tsareena LV 39

Now you can head past her and enter the Poni Breaker Coast.

-------------------
PONI BREAKER COAST:
-------------------
Fishing (Old Rod): Wimpod and Wingull.
Fishing (Good Rod): Relicanth, Sharpedo, and Tentacruel.
Fishing (Super Rod): Wimpod, Wingull, Relicanth, Sharpedo, and Tentacruel.

You can now enter the Poni Breaker Coast. Kiawe is waiting along the path for another fight.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Kiawe
Charizard LV 39
Alolan Marowak LV 40
Turtonator LV 40

In the lower section, there are three items to grab, a Gracidea, a Flyinium-Z, and a Max Revive. There's also another trainer close to the shore.
Tuber Jamie
Sandshrew LV 37
Vulpix LV 37
Geodude LV 37
Graveler LV 37

Below this trainer, you will find Tapu Fini. Net Balls are recommended.
Tapu Fini LV 40

Now we can head inside the cave.
Inside the cave... is no Tapu Fini either. We just missed it, appently... but at least we get a consolation prize of being able to face the Hapu again as the new Island Kahuna.
ICONIC BATTLE
ISLAND KAHUNA HAPU (1v1)
Mudsdale LV 41

Beating her gets you the Steelium-Z. Rotom Dex then tells you that you're done for today and to go back to sleep.

****************************************
* DAY 26: MELTAN, PHEROMOSA, AND GUZMA *
****************************************
When you wake up, it's time to head to the school again. There's an ICONIC LV 40 Meltan in the classroom, all alone and lonely... let's take it with us!

IMPORTANT NOTE: In order for Meltan to evolve, it must level up while HOLDING the Rare Candy, not by eating it.
After you get the Meltan, Head back outside... only for you to hear a commotion inside. Head back in to be confronted by TR.
ICONIC BATTLE
TR Jessie & James
Mimikyu LV 43
Mareanie LV 40
Wobbuffet LV 52

After you beat them, head out of the school again. Rotom Dex will let you know of another Ultra Beast that was spotted on Route 3. Head north there. Note that to the east of the entrance is a pokeball with a Zeraora in it. Be sure to grab that.

On Route 3, head north and you will see Pherosma to the right of the path. Catch it.
Pheromosa LV 40

Afterwards, head back to the school. Kukui is outside talking to Guzma about a possible Pokemon League. Guzma doesn't think it's needed, as he knows he's the strongest. Prove to him how wrong he is.
ICONIC BATTLE
Skull Boss Guzma
Golisopod LV 43

After you beat him, he leaves. Talk to Kukui, who then tells you to head home. 

******************************
* DAY 27: THE KANTONIAN GYM: *
******************************
When you wake up, Rotom Dex tells you to head for the school. In class, Kukui tells you that you're headed for Malie city today. There's reportedly even a gym there. There aren’t meant to be any gyms in Alola… right?

Before we go there, head back to Melemele Forest. A new pokeball containing a Cosmog showed up near the second trainer. Nice! This’ll come in handy if you’re trying to have a full living dex of all the pokemon in the game. Now to go to Malie City, take the boat to Tapu Village, then head east. The boulders that were blocking the path are now gone, allowing us to proceed to Route 12.

---------
ROUTE 12:
---------
Wild Pokemon: Pikipek, Eevee, Passimian, Froslass, Hariyama (LV 30 - 34) 

As you enter route 12, there are 2 grass patches with a trainer in between them to the north, and a beach to the south. Let's head south first.

The beach has 2 more trainers.
Swimmer Sara
Starmie LV 39

MINOR ICONIC
Burglar Hunter D
Seismitoad LV 39

Go south from the female trainer and turn right to find an X Attack nestled between the two boulders on the underside. You can also find a Burn Heal in the boulder above the male trainer, and a visible Psychium-Z. In the rock directly below it, there is a hidden Rare Candy. You can also find a hidden Big Pearl. Start by lining yourself west of the boulder east of the boulder where the Burn Heal was, then go one step up and the Big Pearl is in the tile west of you.

You're done here so head up into the grass patches and fight the trainer between them.
MINOR ICONIC
Cool Trainer De Rosa

Follow the eastern patch to find a Hyper Potion. Follow the path up past a third grass patch and two more trainers.

Grab the Moon Stone below them. Follow the path down, but be sure to grab the PP Up in the rubble right before jumping back down to the starting area. Proceed back up the path and continue past two more grass patches. There will be a trainer and an Elixir at the top of the path as you turn left.
Poke Maniac Andrew (Double Battle)

Cool Couple Sorano & Sho
Gengar LV 37
Clefable LV 38

Just northwest of them is a Big Mushroom in another grass patch. Go back to the path, which now splits into two. On the bottom, you'll find a trainer and a Marshadium-Z. West of it is a rock containing a Stardust.
Black Belt Alvaro
Bewear LV 39

The top path just has another trainer.
Black Belt Clay
Hariyama LV 39

Follow the path as it reconnects, grabbing a hidden Star Piece in the top left corner of the grass southwest of the final trainer of this route in the process. After that, fight him and head into Malie City.
Youngster Hayden
Dedenne LV 39

-----------
MALIE CITY:
-----------
There are six houses in front of you when you enter the city. In the closest house, you'll find a guy who'll give you some items when you beat the gym here. The second house up on the right has a girl who gives you a Twisted Spoon. The third house up on the left has a guy who gives out a Max Repel. To the northeast of the upper-right house is a guy who gives you a Nugget.

East of here there is a green Poke Mart clone that sells type-enhancing items. It has two clerks. The upper one sells:
Hard Stone - 1000
Mystic Water - 1000
Magnet - 1000
Miracle Seed - 1000
Poison Barb - 1000
Twisted Spoon - 1000

To the right of the shop is a Darkinium-Z and a Move Tutor for Sucker Punch.

To the northwest of the 6 houses is a guy whose Eevee are blocking the way. Depending on your answer, he'll give you two or three stones; whichever elements you DIDN'T pick. Two if you picked one of the elements, three if you picked neither. The choice here is obvious.

In the fenced area behind the Pokemon Centre is a girl who will trade her Happiny for a Pancham. The center itself has a woman who will give you a Reaper Cloth.

We've gotten all the goodies we can for now, so let's hit the gym. The leader, Ryuki, uses dragon types so plan accordingly.

****************************
* DAY 28: THE ALOLA LEAGUE *
****************************
When you wake up, Kukui tells you that there's been another Ultra Beast sighting. He recommends that you check in Hau'oli City. Let's head there.

Along the way, stop by the school grounds and pick up the Firium-Z to the west of the school entrance.

After you catch it, Rotom tells you to head back to the school. Before we do, however, head back to Vast Poni Canyon. There is a Poke Ball, near the entrance to Altar of the Sunne, containing another Lv 30 Type: Null!

In class, Kukui announces that it’s time for the Alola League tournament. Before you can take a ferry though, there is a new trainer to fight on the northern edge of the docks.
Bug Catcher Doug
Beedrill (Mega) LV 57
Armaldo LV 55
Galvantula LV 55

---------------

---------------
Wild Pokemon: Toucannon, Butterfree, Wingull, Ribombee, Vulpix, Krabby, Mudsdale, Graveler, Fomantis (LV 35 - 38)

Inside the stadium, business is blooming as usual. Register and head to the first stage, on the far left.

The first stage is a Battle Royale (yes, like the ones in Fortnite!). You must beat three of the trainers in order to proceed to the top 16. They can be any of the trainers in any order.

In terms of experience gained, the best combination is the following:
Ring 1: Kommo-o

Ring 3: Magmortar or Electivire

After you beat him, congrats, you've won the league! You’ll get to see the famous Hall of Fame cutscene. After this, head back outside. There's a bit of a situation with some rowdy Guzzlord. Head around back to help the Masked Royal with his Guzzlord. There's also a free Naganadel to the left of them, in case you needed an extra one. Even though ours never had to leave us, which now gives us two Naganadel if we’d made sure to evolve our Poipole. Or, if we didn't, it now allows us to fill both slots in the PC for a complete living dex.

You might want to consider catching this Guzzlord as well. Not only is it LV 50, it's also shiny.

Once you beat/catch it, the Masked Royal will lose his mask, revealing... Professor Kukui. Who knew, eh? He now challenges you to a full 6v6 exhibition match. Let's head back inside for the grand finale.

It's on the same stage where the finals were.
MAJOR ICONIC LEAGUE BATTLE

Lucario LV 51

**********************************
* DAY 29: AFTER THE ALOLA LEAGUE *
**********************************
Once you wake up, Rotom Dex tells you to head to the school again. Kukui tells the class that their vacation is starting and the school will be on break. The class announces their intentions to split up and do different things.

As a going-away present, however, Kiawe wants to battle you one last time... I think we can oblige him.
ICONIC BATTLE
Pokemon Trainer Kiawe (1v1)
Charizard LV 50

After you beat him, Rotom Dex announces that it's leaving as well to work with the Aether Foundation. Oh well. I guess that's one less thing following us around, plus you can use your bike again, so yay? Wait, isn’t there something else I’m forgetting about…? Oh right, you’d be able to use Escape Ropes but those are currently unusable right now.

Once you've said your goodbyes, go to Lillie's mansion and enter the study. You can find a gift Magearna. Head back outside, back to Kanto, and talk to Oak again. He'll congratulate you on becoming Champion and encourage you to reach for even greater heights... it's a wide world out there, after all!!!

So, what's inside? Battles. Lots and lots of battles. 53 battles in total, against all the Gym Leaders.

There are 18 colored squares on the floor, corresponding to the 18 types, and around each of them are Gym Leaders that use that type.

You will also find Ryuki, the Kantonian Gym Leader from Alola standing outside. Apparently, they didn't have room for him inside.

Please note that contrary to the rest of this walkthrough, the locations for these battles will NOT be given. These are easter eggs for you to find on your own. It took us weeks before we finally found it, and all we can say is that it can be very frustrating. 

Just remember that if you get too mad or frustrated, it almost always helps to sleep on it and come back later. :)

THE END....FOR REAL THIS TIME.
